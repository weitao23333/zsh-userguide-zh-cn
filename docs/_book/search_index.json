UNIX jargon, a `shell\\', because it wraps around the\ncommands you use. More than that, however, zsh is a particularly\npowerful shell --- and it\\'s free, and under regular maintenance ---\nwith lots of interactive features allowing you to do the maximum work\nwith the minimum fuss. Of course, for that you need to know what the\nshell can do and how, and that\\'s what this guide is for.\nThe most basic basics: I shall assume you have access to a UNIX system,\notherwise the rest of this is not going to be much use. You can also use\nzsh under Windows by installing Cygwin, which provides a UNIX-like\nenvironment for programmes --- given the weakness of the standard\nWindows command interpreter, this is a good thing to do. There are ports\nof older versions of zsh to Windows which run natively, i.e. without a\nUNIX environment, although these have a slightly different behaviour in\nsome respects and I won\\'t talk about them further.\nI\\'ll also assume some basic knowledge of UNIX; you should know how the\nfilesystem works, i.e. what /home/users/pws/.zshrc and ../file mean,\nand some basic commands, for example ls, and you should have\nexperience with using rm to delete completely the wrong file by\naccident, and that sort of thing. In something like `rm file\\', I\nwill often refer to the `command\\' (rm, of course) and the\n`argument(s)\\' (anything else coming after the command which is used by\nit), and to the complete thing you typed in one go as the `command\nline\\'.\nYou\\'re also going to need zsh itself; if you\\'re reading this, you may\nwell already have it, but if you don\\'t, you or your system\nadministrator should read Appendix A. For now,\nwe\\'ll suppose you\\'re sitting in front of a terminal with zsh already\nrunning.\nNow to the shell. After you log in, you probably see some prompt (a\nseries of symbols on the screen indicating that you can input a\ncommand), such as `$\\' or `%\\', possibly with some other text in\nfront --- later, we\\'ll see how you can change that text in\ninteresting ways. That prompt comes from the shell. Type\n`print hello\\', then backspace over `hello\\' and type\n`goodbye\\'. Now hit the `Return\\' key (or `Enter\\' key, I\\'ll just\nsay  from now on, likewise  for the tab key,  for\nthe space key); unless you have a serious practical-joker problem on\nyour system, you will see `goodbye\\', and the shell will come back\nwith another prompt. All of the time up to when you hit , you\nwere interacting with the shell and its editor, called `Z-Shell Line\nEditor\\' or `zle\\' for short; only then did the shell go away and tell\nthe print command to print out a message. So you can see that the\nshell is important.\nHowever, if all you\\'re doing is typing simple commands like that, why\ndo you need anything complicated? In that case, you don\\'t; but real\nlife\\'s not that simple. In the rest of this guide, I describe how, with\nzsh\\'s help, you can:\n\ncustomise the environment in which you work, by using startup files,\nwrite your own commands to shorten tasks and store things in shell\nvariables (`parameters\\') so you don\\'t have to remember them,\nuse zle to minimise the amount of typing you have to do --- in\nzsh, you can even edit small files that way,\npick the files you want to use for a particular command such as mv\nor ls using zsh\\'s very sophisticated filename generation (known\ncolloquially as `globbing\\') system,\ntell the editor what sort of arguments you use with particular\ncommands, so that you only need to type part of the name and it will\ncomplete the rest, using zsh\\'s unrivalled programmable completion\nsystem,\nuse the extra add-ons (`modules\\') supplied with the latest version\nof zsh to do other things you usually can\\'t do in a shell at all.\n\nThat\\'s only a tiny sample. Since there\\'s so much to say, this guide\nwill concentrate on the things zsh does best, and in particular the\nthings it has which other shells don\\'t. The next chapter gives a few of\nthe basics, by trying to explain how to set the shell up the way you\nwant it. Like the rest of the guide, it\\'s not intended to be\nexhaustive, for which you should look at the shell manual.\nSome other things you should probably know straight away. First, the\nshell is always running, even when the command you typed is running,\ntoo; the shell simply hangs around waiting for it to finish: you may\nknow from other shells about putting commands in the background by\nputting an `&\\' after the command, which means that the shell\ndoesn\\'t wait for them to finish. The shell is there even if the\ncommand\\'s in the foreground, but in this case doing nothing.\nSecond, it doesn\\'t just run other people\\'s commands, it has some of\nits own, called builtin commands or just builtins, and you can\neven add your own commands as lists of instructions to the shell called\nfunctions; builtins and functions always run in the shell itself.\nThat\\'s important to know, because things which don\\'t run in the shell\nitself can\\'t affect it, and hence can\\'t alter parameters, functions,\naliases, and all the other things I shall talk about.\n[]{#l2}\n1.1: Other shells and other guides\nIf you want a basic grounding in how shells work, what their syntax is\n(i.e. how to write commands), and how to write scripts and functions,\nyou should read one of the many books on the subject. In particular, you\nwill get most out of a book that describes the Korn shell (ksh), as zsh\nis very similar to this --- so similar that it will be worth my while\npointing out differences as we go along, since they can confuse ksh\nusers. Recent versions of zsh can emulate ksh (strictly, the 1988\nversion of ksh, although there are increasingly features from the 1993\nversion) quite closely, although it\\'s not perfect, and less perfect the\nmore closely you look. However, it\\'s important to realise that if you\njust start up any old zsh there is no guarantee that it will be set up\nto work like ksh; unless you or your system adminstrator have changed\nsome settings, it certainly won\\'t be. You might not see that straight\naway, but it affects the shell in subtle ways. I will talk about\nemulation a bit more later on.\nA few other shells are worth mentioning. The grandfather of all UNIX\nshells is sh, now known as the Bourne shell but originally just referred\nto as `the shell\\'. The story is similar to ksh: zsh can emulate sh\nquite closely (much more closely than ksh, since sh is considerably\nsimpler), but in general you need to make sure it\\'s set up to do that\nbefore you can be sure it will emulate sh.\nYou may also come across the `Bourne-Again Shell\\', bash. This is a\nfreely-available enhancement of sh written by the GNU project --- but\nit is not always enhanced along the lines of ksh, and hence in many ways\nit is very different from zsh. On some free UNIX-like systems such as\nLinux/GNU (which is what people usually mean by Linux), the command sh\nis really bash, so there you should be extra careful when trying to\nensure that something which runs under the so-called `sh\\' will also\nrun under zsh. Some Linux systems also have another simpler Bourne shell\nclone, ash; as it\\'s simpler, it\\'s more like the original Bourne shell.\nSome more modern operating systems talk about `the POSIX shell\\'. This\nis an attempt to standardize UNIX shells; it\\'s most like the Korn\nshell, although, a bit confusingly, it\\'s often just called sh, because\nthe standard says that it should be. Usually, this just means you get a\nbit extra free with your sh and it still does what you expect. Zsh has\nmade some attempts to fit the standard, but you have to tell it to ---\nagain, simply starting up `zsh\\' will not have the right settings for\nthat.\nThere is another common family of shells with, unfortunately,\nincompatible syntax. The source of this family is the C-Shell, csh, so\ncalled because its syntax looks more like the C programming language.\nThis became widespread when the only other shell available was sh\nbecause csh had better interactive features, such as job control. It was\nthen enhanced to make tcsh, which has many of the interactive features\nyou will also find in zsh, and so became very popular. Despite these\ncommon features, the syntax of zsh is very different, so you should not\ntry and use csh/tcsh commands beyond the very simplest in zsh; but if\nyou are a tcsh user, you will find virtually every capability you are\nused to in zsh somewhere, plus a lot more.\n[]{#l3}\n1.2: Versions of zsh\nAt the time of writing, the most recent version of zsh available for\nwidespread use was 4.0.6. You will commonly find two sets of older\nzsh\\'s around. The 3.0 series, of which the last release was 3.0.9, was\na stable release, with only bug fixes since the first release of zsh 3.\nThe 3.1 series were beta versions, with lots of new features; the last\nof these, 3.1.9, was not so different from 4.0.1; the main change is\nthat the shell has now been declared stable, so that as with zsh 3 there\nwill be a set of bug fixes, labelled 4.0, and a set with new functions\nin, labelled 4.1. As 4.0 replaces all zsh 3 versions, I will try to keep\nthings simple and talk about that; but every now and then it will be\nhelpful to point out where older versions were different.\nOne notable feature of zsh is the completion of command line arguments.\nThe system changed in 3.1.6 and 3.1.7 to make it a lot more\nconfigurable, and (provided you keep your wits about you) a little less\nobscure. I therefore won\\'t describe the old completion system, which\nused the `compctl\\' command, in any detail; a very brief introduction\nis given in the zsh FAQ. The old system remains available, however we\nstrongly recommend new users to start with the new one. See chapter\n6 `Completion, old and new\\' for the lowdown on\nnew-style completion.\nThere won\\'t be a big difference between 4.0 and 4.1, just bug fixes and\na few evolutionary changes, plus some extra modules. There will be some\nnotes in chapter 7 about new features in 4.1,\nbut nothing you write for 4.0 is likely to become obsolete in the\nforeseeable future.\n[]{#l4}\n1.3: Conventions\nMost of what I say will be reasonably self-contained (which means I use\nphrases like `as I said before\\' and `as I\\'ll discuss later on\\' more\nthan a real stylist would like, and the number times I refer to other\nchapters is excessive), but there are some points I should perhaps draw\nyour attention to before you leap in.\nI will often write chunks of code as you would put them in a file for\nexecution (a `script\\' or a `function\\', the differences to be\ndiscussed passim):\n  if [[ $ZSH_VERSION = 3.* ]]; then\n    print This is a release of the third version of zsh.\n  else\n    print This is either very new or very old.\n  fi\nbut sometimes I will show both what you type into a shell interactively,\nand what the shell throws back at you:\n  % print $ZSH_VERSION\n  3.1.9\n  % print $CPUTYPE\n  i586\nHere, `%\\' shows the prompt the shell puts up to tell you it is\nexpecting input (and the space immediately after is part of it).\nActually, you probably see something before the percent sign like the\nname of the machine or your user name, or maybe something fancier. I\\'ve\npruned it to the minimum to avoid confusion, and kept it as reminder\nthat this is the line you type.\nIf you\\'re reading an electronic version of this guide, and want to copy\nlines with the `%\\' in front into a terminal to be executed, there\\'s\na neat way of doing this where you don\\'t even have to edit the line\nfirst:\n  alias %=' '\nThen % at the start of a line is turned into nothing whatsoever; the\nspace just indicates that any following aliases should be expanded. So\nthe line `% print $CPUTYPE\\' will ignore the `%\\' and execute the\nrest of the line. (I hope it\\'s obvious, but your own prompt is always\nignored; this is just if you copy the prompts from the guide into the\nshell.)\nThere are lots of different types of object in zsh, but one of the most\ncommon is parameters, which I will always show with a `$\\' sign in\nfront, like `$ZSH_VERSION\\', to remind you they are parameters. You\nneed to remember that when you\\'re setting or fiddling with the\nparameter itself, rather than its value, you omit the `$\\'. When you\ndo and don\\'t need it should become clearer as we go along.\nThe other objects I\\'ll show specially are shell options --- choices\nabout how the shell is to work --- which I write like this:\n`SH_WORD_SPLIT\\', `NO_NOMATCH\\', `ZLE\\'. Again, that\\'s not the\nwhole story since whenever the shell expects options you can write them\nin upper or lower case with as many or as few underscores as you like;\nand often in code chunks I\\'ll use the simplest form instead:\n`shwordsplit\\', `nonomatch\\', `zle\\'. If you\\'re philosophical\nyou can think of it as expressing the category difference between\ntalking about programming and actual programming, but really it\\'s just\nme being inconsistent.\nYou may find it odd that I use three hyphens to signify a dash. That\\'s\nactually a convention used in the printed version of this guide, which\nis made with LaTeX. One day, I will turn this into a macro and it will\nappear properly in other versions; but then, one day the universe will\ncome to an end.\n[]{#l5}\n1.4: Acknowledgments\nI am grateful for comments from various zsh users. In particular, I have\nhad detailed comments and corrections from Bart Schaefer, Sven `Mr\nCompletion\\' Wischnowsky and Oliver Kiddle. It\\'s usual to add that any\nremaining errors are my own, but that\\'s so stark staringly obvious as\nto be ridiculous. I mean, who wrote this? Never mind.\nMost of this written on one or another release of Linux Mandrake (a\nderivative of Red Hat), with the usual GNU and XFree86 tools. Since all\nof this was free, it only seems fair to say `thank you\\' for the gift.\nIt also works a lot better than the operating system that came with this\nparticular PC.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide02.html":{"url":"zshguide02.html","title":"章节 2","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n[]{#init}[]{#l6}\nChapter 2: What to put in your startup files\nThere are probably various changes you want to make to the shell\\'s\nbehaviour. All shells have `startup\\' files, containing commands which\nare executed as soon as the shell starts. Like many others, zsh allows\neach user to have their own startup files. In this chapter, I discuss\nthe sorts of things you might want to put there. This will serve as an\nintroduction to what the shell does; by the end, you should have an\ninkling of many of the things which will be discussed in more detail\nlater on and why they are interesting. Sometimes you will find out more\nthan you want to know, such as how zsh differs from other shells you\\'re\nnot going to use. Explaining the differences here saves me having to lie\nabout how the shell works and correcting it later on: most people will\nsimply want to know how the shell normally works, and note that there\nare other ways of doing it.\n[]{#l7}\n2.1: Types of shell: interactive and login shells\nFirst, you need to know what is meant by an interactive and a\nlogin shell. Basically, the shell is just there to take a list of\ncommands and run them; it doesn\\'t really care whether the commands are\nin a file, or typed in at the terminal. In the second case, when you are\ntyping at a prompt and waiting for each command to run, the shell is\ninteractive; in the other case, when the shell is reading commands\nfrom a file, it is, consequently, non-interactive. A list of\ncommands used in this second way --- typically by typing something\nlike zsh filename, although there are shortcuts --- is called a\nscript, as if the shell was acting in a play when it read from it\n(and shells can be real hams when it comes to playacting). When you\nstart up a script from the keyboard, there are actually two zsh\\'s\naround: the interactive one you\\'re typing at, which is waiting for\nanother, non-interactive one to finish running the script. Almost\nnothing that happens in the second one affects the first; they are\ndifferent copies of zsh.\nRemember that when I give examples for you to type, I often show them as\nthey would appear in a script, without prompts in front. What you\nactually see on the screen if you type them in will have a lot more in\nfront.\nWhen you first log into the computer, the shell you are presented with\nis interactive, but it is also a login shell. If you type `zsh\\', it\nstarts up a new interactive shell: because you didn\\'t give it the name\nof a file with commands in, it assumes you are going to type them\ninteractively. Now you\\'ve got two interactive shells at once, one\nwaiting for the other: it doesn\\'t sound all that useful, but there are\ntimes when you are going to make some radical changes to the shell\\'s\nsettings temporarily, and the easiest thing to do is to start another\nshell, do what you want to do, and exit back to the original, unaltered,\nshell --- so it\\'s not as stupid as it sounds.\nHowever, that second shell will not be a login shell. How does zsh know\nthe difference? Well, the programme that logs you in after you type your\npassword (called, predictably, login), actually sticks a `-\\' in\nfront of the name of the shell, which zsh recognises. The other way of\nmaking a shell a login shell is to run it yourself with the option -l;\ntyping `zsh -l\\' will start a zsh that also thinks it\\'s a login\nshell, and later I\\'ll explain how to turn on options within the shell,\nwhich you can do with the login option too. Otherwise, any zsh you start\nyourself will not be a login shell. If you are using X-Windows, and have\na terminal emulator such as xterm running a shell, that is probably not\na login shell. However, it\\'s actually possible to get xterm to start a\nlogin shell by giving it the option -ls, so if you type\n`xterm -ls &\\', you will get a window running a login shell (the &\nmeans the shell in the first window doesn\\'t wait for it to finish).\nThe first main difference between a login shell and any other\ninteractive shell is the one to do with startup files, described below.\nThe other one is what you do when you\\'re finished. With a login shell\nyou can type `logout\\' to exit the shell; with another you type\n`exit\\'. However, `exit\\' works for all shells, interactive,\nnon-interactive, login, whatever, so a lot of people just use that. In\nfact, the only difference is that `logout\\' will tell you\n`not login shell\\' if you use it anywhere else and fail to exit. The\ncommand `bye\\' is identical to `exit\\', only shorter and less\nstandard. So my advice is just to use `exit\\'.\nAs somebody pointed out to me recently, login shells don\\'t have to be\ninteractive. You can always start a shell in the two ways that make it a\nlogin shell; the ways that make it an interactive shell or not are\nindependent. In fact, some start-up scripts for windowing systems run a\nnon-interactive login shell to incorporate definitions from the\nappropriate login scripts before executing the commands to start the\nwindowing session.\n[]{#l8}\n2.1.1: What is a login shell? Simple tests\nTelling if the shell you are looking at is interactive is usually easy:\nif there\\'s a prompt, it\\'s interactive. As you may have gathered,\ntelling if it\\'s a login shell is more involved because you don\\'t\nalways know how the shell was started or if the option got changed. If\nyou want to know, you can type the following (one line at a time if you\nlike, see below),\n  if [[ -o login ]]; then\n    print yes\n  else\n    print no\n  fi\nwhich will print `yes\\' or `no\\' according to whether it\\'s a login\nshell or not; the syntax will be explained as we go along. There are\nshorter ways of doing it, but this illustrates the commonest shell\nsyntax for testing things, something you probably often want to do in a\nstartup file. What you\\'re testing goes inside the `[[ ... ]]\\'; in\nthis case, the -o tells the shell to test an option, here login. The\nnext line says what to do if the test succeeded; the line after the\n`else\\' what to do if the test failed. This syntax is virtually\nidentical to ksh; in this guide, I will not give exhaustive details on\nthe tests you can perform, since there are many of them, but just show\nsome of the most useful. As always, see the manual --- in this case,\n`Conditional Expressions\\' in the zshmisc manual pages.\nAlthough you usually know when a shell is interactive, in fact you can\ntest that in exactly the same way, too: just use\n`[[ -o interactive ]]\\'. This is one option you can\\'t change within\nthe shell; if you turn off reading from the keyboard, where is the shell\nsupposed to read from? But you can at least test it.\nAside for beginners in shell programming: maybe the semicolon looks a\nbit funny; that\\'s because the `then\\' is really a separate command.\nThe semicolon is just instead of putting it on a new line; the two are\ninterchangeable. In fact, I could have written,\n  if [[ -o login ]]; then; print yes; else; print no; fi\nwhich does exactly the same thing. I could even have missed out the\nsemicolons after `then\\' and `else\\', because the shell knows that\na command must come after each of those --- though the semicolon or\nnewline before the then is often important, because the shell does\nnot know a command has to come next, and might mix up the then with\nthe arguments of the command after the `if\\': it may look odd, but\nthe `[[ ... ]]\\' is actually a command. So you will see various\nways of dividing up the lines in shell programmes. You might also like\nto know that print is one of the builtin commands referred to before;\nin other words, the whole of that chunk of programme is executed by the\nshell itself. If you\\'re using a newish version of the shell, you will\nnotice that zsh tells you what it\\'s waiting for, i.e. a `then\\' or\nan `else\\' clause --- see the explanation of $PS2 below for more\non this. Finally, the spaces I put before the `print\\' commands were\nsimply to make it look prettier; any number of spaces can appear before,\nafter, or between commands and arguments, as long as there\\'s at least\none between ordinary words (the semicolon is recognised as special, so\nyou don\\'t need one before that, though it\\'s harmless if you do put one\nin).\nSecond aside for users of sh: you may remember that tests in sh used a\nsingle pair of brackets, `if [ ... ]; then ...\\', or equivalently as\na command called test, `if test ...; then ...\\'. The Korn shell\nwas deliberately made to be different, and zsh follows that. The reason\nis that `[[\\' is treated specially, which allows the shell to do some\nextra checks and allows more natural syntax. For example, you may know\nthat in sh it\\'s dangerous to test a parameter which may be empty: `[\n$var = foo ]\\' will fail if $var is empty, because in that case the\nword is missed out and the shell never knows it was supposed to be\nthere; with `[[ ... ]]\\', this is quite safe because the shell\nis aware there\\'s a word before the `=\\', even if it\\'s empty. Also,\nyou can use `&&\\' and `||\\' to mean logical `and\\' and `or\\',\nwhich agrees with the usual UNIX/C convention; in sh, they would have\nbeen taken as starting a new command, not as part of the test, and you\nhave to use the less clear `-a\\' and `-o\\'. Actually, zsh provides\nthe old form of test for backward compatibility, but things will work a\nlot more smoothly if you don\\'t use it.\n[]{#l9}\n2.2: All the startup files\nNow here\\'s a list of the startup files and when they\\'re run. You\\'ll\nsee they fall into two classes: those in the /etc directory, which are\nput there by the system administrator and are run for all users, and\nthose in your home directory, which zsh, like many shells, allows you to\nabbreviate to a `~\\'. It\\'s possible that the latter files are\nsomewhere else; type `print $ZDOTDIR\\' and if you get something other\nthan a blank line, or an error message telling you the parameter isn\\'t\nset, it\\'s telling you a directory other than `~\\' where your startup\nfiles live. If $ZDOTDIR (another parameter) is not already set, you\nwon\\'t want to set it without a good reason.\n/etc/zshenv\n:   Always run for every zsh.\n~/.zshenv\n:   Usually run for every zsh (see below).\n/etc/zprofile\n:   Run for login shells.\n~/.zprofile\n:   Run for login shells.\n/etc/zshrc\n:   Run for interactive shells.\n~/.zshrc\n:   Run for interactive shells.\n/etc/zlogin\n:   Run for login shells.\n~/.zlogin\n:   Run for login shells.\nNow you know what login and interactive shells are, this should be\nstraightforward. You may wonder why there are both ~/.zprofile and\n~/.zlogin, when they are both for login shells: the answer is the\nobvious one, that one is run before, one after ~/.zshrc. This is\nhistorical; Bourne-type shells run /etc/profile, and csh-type shells\nrun ~/.login, and zsh tries to cover the bases with its own startup\nfiles.\nThe complication is hinted at by the `see below\\'. The file\n/etc/zshenv, as it says, is always run at the start of any zsh.\nHowever, if the option NO_RCS is set (or, equivalently, the RCS\noption is unset: I\\'ll talk about options shortly, since they are\nimportant in startup files), none of the others are run. The most common\nway of setting this option is with a flag on the command line: if you\nstart the shell as `zsh -f\\', the option becomes set, so only\n/etc/zshenv is run and the others are skipped. Often, scripts do this\nas a way of trying to get a basic shell with no frills, as I\\'ll\ndescribe below; but if something is set in /etc/zshenv, there\\'s no\nway to avoid it. This leads to the First Law of Zsh Administration: put\nas little as possible in the file /etc/zshenv, as every single zsh\nwhich starts up has to read it. In particular, if the script assumes\nthat only the basic options are set and /etc/zshenv has altered them,\nit might well not work. So, at the absolute least, you should probably\nsurround any option settings in /etc/zshenv with\n  if [[ ! -o norcs ]]; then\n    ...  ...\n  fi\nand your users will be eternally grateful. Settings for interactive\nshells, such as prompts, have no business in /etc/zshenv unless you\nreally insist that all users have them as defaults for every single\nshell. Script writers who want to get round problems with options being\nchanged in /etc/zshenv should put `emulate zsh\\' at the top of the\nscript.\nThere are two files run at the end: ~/.zlogout and /etc/zlogout, in\nthat order. As their names suggest, they are counterparts of the\nzlogin files, and therefore are only run for login shells --- though\nyou can trick the shell by setting the login option. Note that whether\nyou use exit, bye or logout to leave the shell does not affect\nwhether these files are run: I wasn\\'t lying (this time) when I said\nthat the error message was the only difference between exit and\nlogout. If you want to run a file at the end of any other type of\nshell, you can do it another way:\n  TRAPEXIT() {\n    # commands to run here, e.g. if you \n    # always want to run .zlogout:\n    if [[ ! -o login ]]; then\n      # don't do this in a login shell\n      # because it happens anyway\n      . ~/.zlogout\n    fi\n  }\nIf you put that in .zshrc, it will force .zlogout to be run at the\nend of all interactive shells. Traps will be mentioned later, but this\nis rather a one-off; it\\'s really just a hack to get commands run at the\nend of the shell. I won\\'t talk about logout files, however, since\nthere\\'s little that\\'s standard to put in them; some people make them\nclear the screen to remove sensitive information with the `clear\\'\ncommand. Other than that, you might need to tidy a few files up when you\nexit.\n[]{#l10}\n2.3: Options\nIt\\'s time to talk about options, since I\\'ve mentioned them several\ntimes. Each option describes one particular shell behaviour; they are\nall Boolean, i.e. can either be on or off, with no other state. They\nhave short names and in the documentation and this guide they are\nwritten in uppercase with underscores separating the bits (except in\nactual code, where I\\'ll write them in the short form). However, neither\nof those is necessary. In fact, NO_RCS and norcs and __N_o_R_c_S__\nmean the same thing and are all accepted by the shell.\nThe second thing is that an option with `no\\' in front just means the\nopposite of the option without. I could also have written the test\n`[[ ! -o norcs ]]\\' as `[[ -o rcs ]]\\'; the `!\\' means `not\\',\nas in C. You can only have one `no\\'; `nonorcs\\' is meaningless.\nUnfortunately, there is an option `NOMATCH\\' which has `no\\' as\npart of its basic name, so in this case the opposite really is\n`NO_NOMATCH\\'; NOTIFY, of course, is also a full name in its own\nright.\nThe usual way to set and unset options is with the commands setopt\nand unsetopt which take a string of option names. Some options also\nhave flags, like the `-f\\' for NO_RCS, which these commands also\naccept, but it\\'s much clearer to use the full name and the extra time\nand space is negligible. The command `set -o\\' is equivalent to\nsetopt; this comes from ksh. Note that set with no `-o\\' does\nsomething else --- that sets the positional parameters, which is\nzsh\\'s way of passing arguments to scripts and functions.\nAlmost everybody sets some options in their startup files. Since you\nwant them in every interactive shell, at the least, the choice is\nbetween putting them in ~/.zshrc or ~/.zshenv. The choice really\ndepends on how you use non-interactive shells. They can be started up in\nunexpected places. For example, if you use Emacs and run commands from\ninside it, such as grep, that will start a non-interactive shell,\nand may require some options. My rule of thumb is to put as many options\nas possible into ~/.zshrc, and transfer them to ~/.zshenv if I find\nI need them there. Some purists object to setting options in ~/.zshenv\nat all, since it affects scripts; but, as I\\'ve already hinted, you have\nto work a bit harder to make sure scripts are unaffected by that sort of\nthing anyway. In the following, I just assume they are going to be in\n~/.zshrc.\n[]{#l11}\n2.4: Parameters\nOne more thing you\\'ll need to know about in order to write startup\nfiles is parameters, also known as variables. These are mostly like\nvariables in other programming languages. Simple parameters can be\nstored like this (an assignment):\n  foo='This is a parameter.'\nNote two things: first, there are no spaces around the `=\\'. If there\nwas a space before, zsh would think `foo\\' was the name of a command\nto execute; if there was a space after it, it would assign an empty\nstring to the parameter foo. Second, note the use of quotes to stop\nthe spaces inside the string having the same effect. Single quotes, as\nhere, are the nuclear option of quotes: everything up to another single\nquote is treated as a simple string --- newlines, equal signs,\nunprintable characters, the lot, in this example all would be assigned\nto the variable; for example,\n  foo='This is a parameter.\n  This is still the same parameter.'\nSo they\\'re the best thing to use until you know what you\\'re doing with\ndouble quotes, which have extra effects. Sometimes you don\\'t need them,\nfor example,\n  foo=oneword\nbecause there\\'s nothing in `oneword\\' to confuse the shell; but you\ncould still put quotes there anyway.\nUsers of csh should note that you don\\'t use `set\\' to set\nparameters. This is important because there is a set command, but it\nworks differently --- if you try `set var=\"this wont't work\"\\', you\nwon\\'t get an error but you won\\'t set the parameter, either. Type\n`print $1\\' to see what you did set instead.\nTo get back what was stored in a parameter, you use the name somewhere\non the command line with a `$\\' tacked on the front --- this is\ncalled an expansion, or to be more precise, since there are other\ntypes of expansion, a parameter expansion. For example, after the\nfirst assignment above.\n  print -- '$foo is \"'$foo'\"'\ngives\n  $foo is \"This is a parameter.\"\nso you can see what I meant about the effect of single quotes. Note the\nasymmetry --- there is no `$\\' when assigning the parameter, but\nthere is a `$\\' in front to have it expanded it into the command\nline. You may find the word `substitution\\' used instead of\n`expansion\\' sometimes; I\\'ll try and stick with the terminology in the\nmanual.\nTwo more things while we\\'re at it. First, why did I put `-``-\\'\nafter the print? That\\'s because print, like many UNIX commands,\ncan take options after it which begin with a `-\\'. `-``-\\' says\nthat there are no more options; so if what you\\'re trying to print\nbegins with a `-\\', it will still print out. Actually, in this case\nyou can see it doesn\\'t, so you\\'re safe; but it\\'s a good habit to get\ninto, and I wish I had. As always in zsh, there are exceptions; for\nexample, if you use the -R option to print before the `-``-\\', it\nonly recognizes BSD-style options, which means it doesn\\'t understand\n`-``-\\'. Indeed, zsh programmers can be quite lax about standards and\noften use the old, but now non-standard, single `-\\' to show there\nare no more options. Currently, this works even after -R.\nThe next point is that I didn\\'t put spaces between the single quotes\nand the $foo and it was still expanded --- expansion happens\nanywhere the parameter is not quoted; it doesn\\'t have to be on its own,\njust separated from anything which might make it look like a different\nparameter. This is one of those things that can help make shell scripts\nlook so barbaric.\nAs well as defining your own parameters, there are also a number which\nthe shell sets itself, and some others which have a special effect when\nyou set them. All the above still applies, though. For the rest of this\nguide, I will indicate parameters with the `$\\' stuck in front, to\nremind you what they are, but you should remember that the `$\\' is\nmissing when you set them, or, indeed, any time when you\\'re referring\nto the name of the parameter instead of its value.\n[]{#l12}\n2.4.1: Arrays\nThere is a special type of parameter called an array which zsh\ninherited from both ksh and csh. This is a slightly shaky marriage,\nsince some of the things those two shells do with them are not\ncompatible, and zsh has elements of both, so you need to be careful if\nyou\\'ve used arrays in either. The option KSH_ARRAYS is something you\ncan set to make them behave more like they do in ksh, but a lot of zsh\nusers write functions and scripts assuming it isn\\'t set, so it can be\ndangerous.\nUnlike normal parameters (known as scalars), arrays have more than\none word in them. In the examples above, we made the parameter $foo\nget a string with spaces in, but the spaces weren\\'t significant. If\nwe\\'d done\n  foo=(This is a parameter.)\n(note the absence of quotes), it would have created an array. Again,\nthere must be no space between the `=\\' and the `(\\', though inside\nthe parentheses spaces separate words just like they do on a command\nline. The difference isn\\'t obvious if you try and print it --- it\nlooks just the same --- but now try this:\n  print -- ${foo[4]}\nand you get `parameter.\\'. The array stores the words separately, and\nyou can retrieve them separately by putting the number of the element of\nthe array in square brackets. Note also the braces `{...}\\' --- zsh\ndoesn\\'t always require them, but they make things much clearer when\nthings get complicated, and it\\'s never wrong to put them in: you could\nhave said `${foo}\\' when you wanted to print out the complete\nparameter, and it would be treated identically to `$foo\\'. The braces\nsimply screen off the expansion from whatever else might be lying around\nto confuse the shell. It\\'s useful too in expressions like `${foo}s\\'\nto keep the `s\\' from being part of the parameter name; and, finally,\nwith KSH_ARRAYS set, the braces are compulsory, though unfortunately\narrays are indexed from 0 in that case.\nYou can use quotes when defining arrays; as before, this protects\nagainst the shell thinking the spaces are between different elements of\nthe array. Try:\n  foo=('first element' 'second element')\n  print -- ${foo[2]}\nArrays are useful when the shell needs to keep a whole series of\ndifferent things together, so we\\'ll meet some you may want to put in a\nstartup file. Users of ksh will have noticed that things are a bit\ndifferent in zsh, but for now I\\'ll just assume you\\'re using the normal\nzsh way of doing things.\n[]{#l13}\n2.5: What to put in your startup files\nAt the last count there were over 130 options and several dozen\nparameters which are special to the shell, and many of them deal with\nthings I won\\'t talk about till much later. But as a guide to get you\nstarted, and an indication of what\\'s to come, here are some options and\nparameters you might want to think about setting in ~/.zshrc.\n[]{#l14}\n2.5.1: Compatibility options: SH_WORD_SPLIT and others\nI\\'ve already mentioned that zsh works differently from ksh, its nearest\nstandard relative, and that some of these differences can be confusing\nto new users, for example the use of arrays. Some options like\nKSH_ARRAYS exist to allow you to have things work the ksh way. Most of\nthese are fairly finnicky, but one catches out a lot of people. Above, I\nsaid that after\n  foo='This is a parameter.'\nthen $foo would be treated as one word. In traditional Bourne-like\nshells including sh, ksh and bash, however, the shell will split $foo\non any spaces it finds. So if you run a command\n  command $foo\nthen in zsh the command gets a single argument\n`This is a parameter.\\', but in the other shells it gets the first\nargument `This\\', the second argument `is\\', and so on. If you\nlike this, or are so used to it it would be confusing to change, you\nshould set the option SH_WORD_SPLIT in your ~/.zshrc. Most\nexperienced zsh users use arrays when they want word splitting, since as\nI explained you have control over what is split and what is not; that\\'s\nwhy SH_WORD_SPLIT is not set by default. Users of other shells just\nget used to putting things in double quotes,\n  command \"$foo\"\nwhich, unlike single quotes, allow the `$\\' to remain special, and\nhave the side effect that whatever is in quotes will remain a single\nword (though there\\'s an exception to that, too: the parameter $@).\nThere are a lot of other options doing similar things to keep users of\nstandard shells happy. Many of them simply turn features off, because\nthe other shell doesn\\'t have them and hence unexpected things might\nhappen, or simply tweak a feature which is a little different or\ndoesn\\'t usually matter. Currently such options include NO_BANG_HIST,\nBSD_ECHO (sh only), IGNORE_BRACES, INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS,\nKSH_OPTION_PRINT, NO_MULTIOS, POSIX_BUILTINS, PROMPT_BANG,\nSINGLE_LINE_ZLE (I\\'ve written them how they would appear as an\nargument to setopt to put the option the way the other shell expects,\nso some have `NO_\\' in front). Most people probably won\\'t change\nthose unless they notice something isn\\'t working how they expect.\nSome others have more noticeable effects. Here are a few of the ones\nmost likely to make you scratch your head if you\\'re changing from\nanother Bourne-like shell.\nBARE_GLOB_QUAL, GLOB_SUBST, SH_FILE_EXPANSION, SH_GLOB,\nKSH_GLOB\\\nThese are all to do with how pattern matching works. You probably\nalready know that the pattern `*.c\\' will be expanded into all the\nfiles in the current directory ending in `.c\\'. Simple uses like this\nare the same in all shells, and the way filenames are expanded is often\nreferred to as `globbing\\' for historical reasons (apparently it stood\nfor `global replacement\\'), hence the name of some of these options.\nHowever, zsh and ksh differ over more complicated patterns. For example,\nto match either file foo.c or file bar.c, in ksh you would say\n@(foo|bar).c. The usual zsh way of doing things is (foo|bar).c. To\nturn on the ksh way of doing things, set the option KSH_GLOB; to turn\noff the zsh way, set the options SH_GLOB and NO_BARE_GLOB_QUAL. The\nlast of those turns off qualifiers, a very powerful way of selecting\nfiles by type (for example, directories or executable files) instead of\nby name which I\\'ll talk about in chapter 5.\nThe other two need a bit more explanation. Try this:\n  foo='*'\n  print $foo\nIn zsh, you usually get a `*\\' printed, while in ksh the `*\\' is\nexpanded to all the files in the directory, just as if you had typed\n`print *\\'. This is a little like SH_WORD_SPLIT, in that ksh is\npretending that the value of $foo appears on the command line just as\nif you typed it, while zsh is using what you assigned to foo without\nallowing it to be changed any more. To allow the word to be expanded in\nzsh, too, you can set the option GLOB_SUBST. As with SH_WORD_SPLIT,\nthe way around the ksh behaviour if you don\\'t want the value changed is\nto use double quotes: \"$foo\".\nYou are less likely to have to worry about SH_FILE_EXPANSION. It\ndetermines when the shell expands things like ~/.zshrc to the full\npath, e.g. /home/user2/pws/.zshrc. In the case of zsh, this is usually\ndone quite late, after most other forms of expansion such as parameter\nexpansion. That means if you set GLOB_SUBST and do\n  foo='~/.zshrc'\n  print $foo\nyou would normally see the full path, starting with a `/\\'. If you\nalso set SH_FILE_EXPANSION, however, the `~\\' is tested much\nearlier, before $foo is replaced when there isn\\'t one yet, so that\n`~/.zshrc\\' would be printed. This (with both options) is the way ksh\nworks. It also means I lied when I said ksh treats $foo exactly as if\nits value had been typed, because if you type print ~/.zshrc the\n`~\\' does get expanded. So you see how convenient lying is.\nNOMATCH, BAD_PATTERN\\\nThese also relate to patterns which produce file names, but in this case\nthey determine what happens when the pattern doesn\\'t match a file for\nsome reason. There are two possible reasons: either no file happened to\nmatch, or you didn\\'t use a proper pattern. In both cases, zsh, unlike\nksh, prints an error message. For example,\n  % print nosuchfile*\n  zsh: no matches found: nosuchfile*\n  % print [-\n  zsh: bad pattern: [-\n(Remember the `%\\' lines are what you type, with a prompt in front\nwhich comes from the shell.) You can see there are two different error\nmessages: you can stop the first by setting NO_NOMATCH, and the second\nby setting NO_BAD_PATTERN. In both cases, that makes the shell print\nout what you originally type without any expansion when there are no\nmatching files.\nBG_NICE, NOTIFY\\\nAll UNIX shells allow you to start a background job by putting `&\\'\nat the end of the line; then the shell doesn\\'t wait for the job to\nfinish, so you can type something else. In zsh, such jobs are usually\nrun at a lower priority (a `higher nice value\\' in UNIX-speak), so that\nthey don\\'t use so much of the processor\\'s time as foreground jobs (all\nthe others, without the `&\\') do. This is so that jobs like editing\nor using the shell don\\'t get slowed down, which can be highly annoying.\nYou can turn this feature off by setting NO_BG_NICE.\nWhen a background job finishes, zsh usually tells you immediately by\nprinting a message, which interrupts whatever you\\'re doing. You can\nstop this by setting NO_NOTIFY. Actually, this is an option in most\nversions of ksh, too, but it\\'s a little less annoying in zsh because if\nit happens while you\\'re typing something else to the shell, the shell\nwill reprint the line you were on as far as you\\'ve got. For example:\n  % sleep 3 &\n  [1] 40366\n  % print The quick brown\n  [1]  + 40366 done       sleep 3\n  % print The quick brown\nThe command sleep simply does nothing for however many seconds you tell\nit, but here it did it in the background (zsh printed a message to tell\nyou). After you typed for three seconds, the job exited, and with\nNOTIFY set it printed out another message: the `done\\' is the key\nthing, as it tells you the job has finished. But zsh was smart enough to\nknow the display was messed up, so it reprinted the line you were\nediting, and you can continue. If you were already running another\nprogramme in the foreground, however, that wouldn\\'t know that zsh had\nprinted the message, so the display would still be messed up.\nHUP\\\nSignals are the way of persuading a job to do something it doesn\\'t want\nto, such as die; when you type ^C, it sends a signal (called SIGINT\nin this case) to the job. In zsh, if you have a background job running\nwhen the shell exits, the shell will assume you want that to be killed;\nin this case it is sent a particular signal called `SIGHUP\\' which\nstands for `hangup\\' (as in telephone, not as in Woody Allen) and is\nthe UNIX equivalent of `time to go home\\'. If you often start jobs that\nshould go on even when the shell has exited, then you can set the option\nNO_HUP, and background jobs will be left alone.\nKSH_ARRAYS\\\nI\\'ve already mentioned this, but here are the details. Suppose you have\ndefined an array arr, for example with\n  arr=(foo bar)\nalthough the syntax in ksh, which zsh also allows, is\n  set -A arr foo bar\nIn zsh, $arr gives out the whole array; in ksh it just produces the\nfirst element. In zsh, ${arr[1]} refers to the first element of the\narray, i.e. foo, while in ksh the first element is referred to as\n${arr[0]} so that ${arr[1]} gives you bar. Finally, in zsh you can\nget away with $arr[1] to refer to an element, while ksh insists on the\nbraces. By setting KSH_ARRAYS, zsh will switch to the ksh way of doing\nthings. This is one option you need to be particularly careful about\nwhen writing functions and scripts.\nFUNCTION_ARG_ZERO\\\nShell functions are a useful way of specifying a set of commands to be\nrun by the shell. Here\\'s a simple example:\n  % fn() { print My name is $0; }\n  % fn\n  My name is fn\nNote the special syntax: the `()\\' appears after a function name to\nsay you are defining one, then a set of commands appears between the\n`{ ... }\\'. When you type the name of the function, those commands\nare executed. If you know the programming language C, the syntax will be\npretty familiar, although note that the `()\\' is a bit of a delusion:\nyou might think you would put arguments to the function in there, but\nyou can\\'t, it must always appear simply as `()\\'. If you don\\'t know\nC, it doesn\\'t matter; nothing from C really applies in detail, it\\'s\njust a superficial resemblance.\nIn this case, zsh printed the special parameter `$0\\' (`argument\nzero\\') and, as you see, that turned into the name of the function. Now\n$0 outside a function means the name of the shell, or the name of the\nscript for a non-interactive shell, so if you type `print $0\\' it\nwill probably say `zsh\\'. In most versions of ksh, this is $0\\'s\nonly use; it doesn\\'t change in functions, and `fn\\' would print\n`ksh\\'. To get this behaviour, you can set NO_FUNCTION_ARG_ZERO.\nThere\\'s probably no reason why you would want to, but zsh functions\nquite often test their own name, so this is one reason why they might\nnot work.\nThere\\'s another difference when defining functions, irrespective of\nFUNCTION_ARG_ZERO: in zsh, you can get away without the final `;\\'\nbefore the end of the definition of fn, because it knows the `}\\'\nmust finish the last command as well as the function; but ksh is not so\nforgiving here. Lots of syntactic know-alls will probably be able to\ntell you why that\\'s a good thing, but fortunately I can\\'t.\nKSH_AUTOLOAD\\\nThere\\'s an easy way of loading functions built into both ksh and zsh.\nInstead of putting them all together in a big startup file, you can put\na single line in that,\n  autoload fn\nand the function `fn\\' will only be loaded when you run it by typing\nits name as a command. The shell needs to know where the function is\nstored. This is done by a special parameter called $fpath, an array\nwhich is a list of directories; it will search all the directories for a\nfile called fn, and use that as the function definition. If you want\nto try this you can type `autoload fn; fpath=(. $fpath)\\' and write a\nfile called fn in the current directory.\nUnfortunately ksh and zsh disagree a bit about what should be in that\nfile. The normal zsh way of doing things is just putting the body of the\nfunction there. So if the file fn is autoloadable and contains,\n  # this is a simple function\n  print My name is $0\nthen typing `fn\\' will have exactly the same effect as the function\nfn above, printing `My name is fn\\'. Zsh users tend to like this\nbecause the function is written the same way as a script; if instead you\nhad typed zsh fn, to call the file as a script with a new copy of zsh\nof its own, it would have worked the same way. The first line is a\ncomment; it\\'s ignored, and in zsh not even autoloaded when the function\nis run, so it\\'s not only much clearer to add explanatory contents, it\nalso doesn\\'t use any more memory either. It uses more disk space, of\ncourse, but nowadays even home PCs come with the sort of disk size which\nallows you a little indulgence with legibility.\nHowever, ksh does things differently, and here the file fn needs to\ncontain\n  fn() {\n    # this is a simple function\n    print My name is $0\n  }\nin other words, exactly what you would type to define the function. The\nadvantage of this form is that you can put other things in the file,\nwhich will then be run straight away and forgotten about, such as\ndefining things that fn may need to use but which don\\'t need to be\nredefined every single time you run fn. The option to force zsh to\nwork the ksh way here is called KSH_AUTOLOAD. (If you wanted to try\nthe second example, you would need to type\n`unfunction fn; autoload fn\\' to remove the function from memory and\nmark it for autoloading again.)\nActually, zsh is a little bit cleverer. If the option KSH_AUTOLOAD is\nnot set, but the file contains just a function definition in the ksh\nform and nothing else (like the last one above, in fact), then zsh\nassumes that it needs to run the function just loaded straight away. The\nother possibility would be that you wanted to define a function which\ndid nothing other than define a function of the same name, which is\nassumed to be unlikely --- and if you really want to do that, you will\nneed to trick zsh by putting a do-nothing command in the same file, such\nas a `:\\' on the last line.\nA final complication --- sorry, but this one actually happens --- is\nthat sometimes in zsh you want to define not just the function to be\ncalled, but some others to help it along. Then you need to do this:\n  fn() {\n    # this is the function after which the file is named\n  }\n  helper() {\n    # goodness knows what this does\n  }\n  fn \"$@\"\n  # this actually calls the function the first time,\n  # with any arguments passed (see the subsection\n  # `Function Parameters' in the section `Functions'\n  # of the next chapter for the \"$@\").\nThat last non-comment line is unnecessary with KSH_AUTOLOAD. The\nfunctions supplied with zsh assume that KSH_AUTOLOAD is not set,\nhowever, so you shouldn\\'t turn it on unless you need to. You could just\nmake fn into the whole body, as usual, and define helper inside\nthat; the problem is that helper would be redefined each time you\nexecuted fn, which is inefficient. A better way of avoiding the\nproblem would be to define helper as a completely separate function,\nitself autoloaded: in both zsh and ksh, it makes no difference whether a\nfunction is defined inside another function or outside it, unlike (say)\nPascal or Scheme.\nLOCAL_OPTIONS, LOCAL_TRAPS\\\nThese two options also refer to functions, and here the ksh way of doing\nthings is usually preferable, so many people set at least\nLOCAL_OPTIONS in a lot of their functions. The first versions of zsh\ndidn\\'t have these, which is why you need to turn them on by hand.\nIf LOCAL_OPTIONS is set in a function (or was already set before the\nfunction, and not unset inside it), then any options which are changed\ninside the function will be put back the way they were when the function\nfinishes. So\n  fn() {\n    setopt localoptions kshglob\n    ...\n  }\nallows you to use a function with the ksh globbing syntax, but will make\nsure that the option KSH_GLOB is restored to whatever it was before\nwhen the function exits. This works even if the function was interrupted\nby typing ^C. Note that LOCAL_OPTIONS will itself be restored to the\nway it was.\nThe option LOCAL_TRAPS, which first appeared in version 3.1.6, is for\na similar reason but refers to (guess what) traps, which are a way\nof stopping signals sent to the shell, for example by typing ^C to\ncancel something (SIGINT, short for `signal interrupt\\'), or ^Z to\nsuspend it temporarily (SIGTSTP, `signal terminal stop\\'), or\nSIGHUP which we\\'ve already met, and so on. To do something of your\nown when the shell gets a ^C, you can do\n  trap 'print I caught a SIGINT' INT\nand the set of commands in quotes will be run when the ^C arrives (you\ncan even try it without running anything). If the string is empty (just\n'``' with nothing inside), the signal will be ignored; typing ^C has\nno effect. To put it back to normal, the command is `trap - INT\\'.\nTraps are most useful in functions, where you may temporarily (say) not\nwant things to stop when you hit ^C, or you may want to clear up\nsomething before returning from the function. So now you can guess what\nLOCAL_TRAPS does; with\n  fn() {\n    setopt localoptions localtraps\n    trap '' INT\n    ...\n  }\nthe shell will ignore ^C\\'s to the end of the function, but then put\nback the trap that was there before, or remove it completely if there\nwas none. Traps are described in more detail in chapter\n3.\nThere is a very convenient shorthand for making options and traps local,\nas well as for setting the others to their standard values: put\n`emulate -L zsh\\' at the start of a function. This sets the option\nvalues back to the ones set when zsh starts, but with LOCAL_OPTIONS\nand LOCAL_TRAPS set too, so you now know exactly how things are going\nto work for the rest of the function, whatever options are set in the\noutside world. In fact, this only changes the options which affect\nnormal programming; you can set every option which it makes sense to set\nto its standard value with `emulate -RL zsh\\' (it doesn\\'t, for\nexample, make sense to change options like login at this point).\nFurthermore, you can make the shell behave as much like ksh as it knows\nhow to by doing `emulate -L ksh\\', with or without the -R.\nThe -L option to emulate actually only appears in versions from\n3.0.6 and 3.1.6. Before that you needed\n  emulate zsh\n  setopt localoptions\nsince localtraps didn\\'t exist, and indeed doesn\\'t exist in 3.0.6\neither.\nPROMPT_PERCENT, PROMPT_SUBST\\\nAs promised, setting prompts will be discussed later, but for now there\nare two ways of getting information into prompts, such as the parameter\n$PS1 which determines the usual prompt at the start of a new command\nline. One is by using percent escapes, which means a `%\\' followed\nby another character, maybe with a number between the two. For example,\nthe default zsh prompt is `%m%#\\'. The first percent escape turns\ninto the name of the host computer, the second usually turns into a\n`%\\', but a `#\\' for the superuser. However, ksh doesn\\'t have\nthese, so you can turn them off by setting NO_PROMPT_PERCENT.\nThe usual ksh way of doing things, on the other hand, is by putting\nparameters in the prompt to be substituted. To get zsh to do this, you\nhave to set PROMPT_SUBST. Then assigning\n  PS1='${PWD}% '\nis another way of putting the name of the current directory (`$PWD\\'\nis presumably named after the command `pwd\\' to `print working\ndirectory\\') into the prompt. Note the single quotes, so that this\nhappens when the prompt is shown, not when it is assigned. If they\nweren\\'t there, or were double quotes, then the $PWD would be expanded\nto the directory when the assignment took place, probably your home\ndirectory, and wouldn\\'t change to reflect the directory you were\nactually in. Of course, you need the quotes for the space, too, else it\njust gets swallowed up when the assignment is executed.\nAs there is potentially much more information available in parameters\nthan the fixed number of predefined percent escapes, you may wish to set\nPROMPT_SUBST anyway. Furthermore, you can get the output of commands\ninto prompts since other forms of expansion are done on them, not just\nthat of parameters; in fact, prompts with PROMPT_SUBST are expanded\npretty much the same as a string inside double quotes every time the\nprompt is displayed.\nRM_STAR_SILENT\\\nEverybody at some time or another deletes more files than they mean to\n(and that\\'s a gross understatement); my favourite is:\n  rm *>o\nThat `>\\' should be a `.\\', but I still had the shift key pressed.\nThis removes all files, echoing the output (there isn\\'t any) into a\nfile `o\\'. Delightfully, the empty file `o\\' is not removed. (Don\\'t\ntry this at home.)\nThere is a protection mechanism built into zsh to stop you deleting all\nthe files in a directory by accident. If zsh finds that the command is\n`rm\\', and there is a `*\\' on the command line (there may be other\nstuff as well), then it will ask you if you really want to delete all\nthose files. You can turn this off by setting RM_STAR_SILENT.\nOverreliance on this option is a bad idea; it\\'s only a last line of\ndefence.\nSH_OPTION_LETTERS\\\nMany options also have single letters to stand for them; you can set an\noption in this way by, for example, `set -f\\', which sets NO_RCS.\nHowever, even where sh, ksh and zsh share options, not all have the same\nletters. This option allows the single letter options to be more like\nthose in sh and ksh. Look them up in the manual if you want to know, but\nI already recommended that you use the full names for options anyway.\nSH_WORD_SPLIT\\\nI\\'ve already talked about this, see above, but it\\'s mentioned here so\nyou don\\'t forget it, since it\\'s an important difference.\nStarting zsh as ksh\\\nFinally on the subject of compatibility, you might like to know that as\nwell as `emulate\\' there is another way of forcing zsh to behave as\nmuch like sh or ksh as possible. This is by actually calling zsh under\nthe name ksh. You don\\'t need to rename zsh, you can make a link from\nthe name zsh to the name ksh, which will be enough to convince it.\nThere is an easier way when you are doing this from within zsh itself.\nThe parameter $ARGV0 is special; it is the value which will be passed\nas the first argument of a command which is run by the shell. Normally\nthis is the name of the command, but it doesn\\'t have to be since the\ncommand only finds out what it is after it has already been run. You can\nuse it to trick a programme into thinking its name is different. So\n  ARGV0=ksh zsh\nwill start a copy of zsh that tries to make itself like ksh. Note this\ndoesn\\'t work unless you\\'re already in zsh, as the $ARGV0 won\\'t be\nspecial.\nI haven\\'t mentioned putting a parameter assignment before a command\nname, but that simply assigns the parameter (strictly an environment\nvariable in this case) for the duration of the command; the value\n$ARGV0 won\\'t be set after that command (the ksh-like zsh) finishes,\nas you can easily test with print. While I\\'m here, I should mention a\nfew of its other features. First, the parameter is automatically\nexported to the environment, meaning it\\'s available for other\nprogrammes started by zsh (including, in this case, the new zsh) ---\nsee the section on environment variables below. Second, this doesn\\'t do\nwhat you might expect:\n  FOO=bar print $FOO\nbecause of the order of expansion: the command line and its parameters\nare expanded before execution, giving whatever value $FOO had before,\nprobably none, then FOO=bar is put into the environment, and then the\ncommand is executed but doesn\\'t use the new value of $FOO.\n[]{#l15}\n2.5.2: Options for csh junkies\nAs well as old ksh users, there are some options available to make old\ncsh and tcsh users feel more at home. As you will already have noticed,\nthe syntax is very different, so you are never going to feel completely\nat home and it might be best just to remember the fact. But here is a\nbrief list. The last, CSH_NULL_GLOB, is actually quite useful.\nCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\\\nZsh has the old csh mechanism for referring to words on a previous\ncommand line using a `!\\'; it\\'s less used, now the editor is more\npowerful, but is still a convenient shorthand for extracting short bits\nfrom the previous line. This mechanism is sometimes called\nbang-history, since busy people sometimes like to say `!\\' as\n`bang\\'. This option affects how a single `!\\' works. For example,\n  % print foo bar\n  % print open closed\n  % print !-2:1 !:2\nIn the last line, `!-2\\' means two entries ago, i.e. the line\n`print foo bar\\'. The `:1\\' chooses the first word after the\ncommand, i.e. `foo\\'. In the second expression, no number is given\nafter the `!\\'. Usually zsh interprets that to mean that the same\nitem just selected, in this case -2, should be used. With\nCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY set, it refers instead to the last command. Note\nthat if you hadn\\'t given that -2, it would refer to the last command in\nany case, although the explicit way of referring to the last command is\n`!!\\' --- you have to use that if there are no `:\\' bits\nfollowing. In summary, zsh usually gives you `print foo bar\\'; with\nCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY you get `print foo closed\\'.\nThere\\'s another option controlling this, BANG_HIST. If you unset\nthat, the mechanism won\\'t work at all. There\\'s also a parameter,\n$histchars. The first character is the main history expansion\ncharacter, normally `!\\' of course; the second is for rapid\nsubstitutions (normally `^\\' --- use of this is described below);\nthe third is the character introducing comments, normally `#\\'.\nChanging the third character is definitely not recommended. There\\'s\nlittle real reason to change any.\nCSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS\\\nNormal zsh loops look something like this,\n  while true; do\n    print Never-ending story\n  done\nwhich just prints the message over and over (type it line-by-line at the\nprompt, if you like, then ^C to stop it). With CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS set,\nyou can instead do\n  while true\n    print Never-ending story\n  end\nwhich will, of course, make your zsh code unlike most other people\\'s,\nso for most users it\\'s best to learn the proper syntax.\nCSH_NULL_GLOB\\\nThis is another of the family of options like NO_NOMATCH, already\nmentioned. In this case, if you have a command line consisting of a set\nof patterns, at least one of them must match at least one file, or an\nerror is caused; any that don\\'t match are removed from the command\nline. The default is that all of them have to match. There is one final\nmember of this set of options, NULL_GLOB: all non-matching patterns\nare removed from the command line, no error is caused. As a summary,\nsuppose you enter the command `print file1* file2*\\' and the\ndirectory contains just the file file1.c.\n\nBy default, there must be files matching both patterns, so an error\nis reported.\nWith NO_NOMATCH set, any patterns which don\\'t match are left\nalone, so `file1.c file2*\\' is printed.\nWith CSH_NULL_GLOB set, file1* matched, so file2* is silently\nremoved; `file1.c\\' is reported. If that had not been there, an\nerror would have been reported.\nWith NULL_GLOB set, any patterns which don\\'t match are removed,\nso again `file1.c\\' is printed, but in this case if that had not\nbeen there a blank line would have been printed, with no error.\n\nCSH_NULL_GLOB is good thing to have set since it can keep you on the\nstraight and narrow without too many unwanted error messages, so this\ntime it\\'s not just for csh junkies.\nCSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES\\\nHere just for completeness. Csh and friends don\\'t allow multiline\nquotes, as zsh does; if you don\\'t finish a pair of quotes before a new\nline, csh will complain. This option makes zsh do the same. But\nmulti-line quotes are very useful and very common in zsh scripts and\nfunctions; this is only for people whose minds have been really screwed\nup by using csh.\n[]{#l16}\n2.5.3: The history mechanism: types of history\nThe name `history mechanism\\' refers to the fact that zsh keeps a\n`history\\' of the commands you have typed. There are three ways of\ngetting these back; all these use the same set of command lines, but the\nmechanisms for getting at them are rather different. For some reason,\nitems in the history list (a complete line of input typed and executed\nat once) have become known as `events\\'.\nEditing the history directly\\\nFirst, you can use the editor; usually hitting up-arrow will take you to\nthe previous line, and down-arrow takes you back. This is usually the\neasiest way, since you can see exactly what you\\'re doing. I will say a\ngreat deal more about the editor in chapter 4;\nthe first thing to know is that its basic commands work either like\nemacs, or like vi, so if you know one of those, you can start editing\nlines straight away. The shell tries to guess whether to use emacs or vi\nfrom the environment variables $VISUAL or $EDITOR, in that order;\nthese traditionally hold the name of your preferred editor for\nprogrammes which need you to edit text. In the old days, $VISUAL was a\nfull-screen editor and $EDITOR a line editor, like ed of blessed\nmemory, but the distinction is now very blurred. If either contains the\nstring vi, the line editor will start in vi mode, else it will start\nin emacs mode. If you\\'re in the wrong mode, `bindkey -e\\' in\n~/.zshrc takes you to emacs mode and `bindkey -v\\' to vi mode. For\nvi users, the thing to remember is that you start in insert mode, so\ntype `ESC\\' to be able to enter vi commands.\n`Bang\\'-history\\\nSecond, you can use the csh-style `bang-history\\' mechanism (unless you\nhave set the option NO_BANG_HIST); the `bang\\' is the exclamation\nmark, `!\\', also known as `pling\\' or `shriek\\' (or factorial, but\nthat\\'s another story). Thus `!!\\' retrieves the last command line\nand executes it; `!-2\\' retrieves the second last. You can select\nwords: `!!:1\\' picks the first word after the command of the last\ncommand (if you were paying attention above, you will note you just need\none `!\\' in that case); 0 after colon would pick the command word\nitself; `*\\' picks all arguments after the command; `$\\' picks the\nlast word. You can even have ranges: `!!:1-3\\' picks those three\nwords, and things like `!!:3-$\\' work too.\nAfter the word selector, you can have a second set of colons and then\nsome special commands called modifiers --- these can be very\nuseful to remember, since they can be applied to parameters and file\npatterns to, so here\\'s some more details. The `:t\\' (tail) modifier\npicks the last part of a filename, everything after the last slash;\nconversely, `:h\\' (head) picks everything before that. So with a\nhistory entry,\n  % print /usr/bin/cat\n  /usr/bin/cat\n  % print !!:t\n  print cat\n  cat\nNote two things: first, the bang-history mechanism always prints what\nit\\'s about to execute. Secondly, you don\\'t need the word selector; the\nshell can tell that the `:t\\' is a modifier, and assumes you want it\napplied to the entire previous command. (Be careful here, since actually\nthe :t will reduce the expression to everything after the last slash\nin any word, which is a little unexpected.)\nWith parameters:\n  % foo=/usr/bin/cat\n  % print ${foo:h}\n  /usr/bin\n(you can usually omit the `{\\' and `}\\', but it\\'s clearer and\nsafer with them). And finally with files --- this won\\'t work if you\nset NO_BARE_GLOB_QUAL for sh-like behaviour:\n  % print /usr/bin/cat(:t)\n  cat\nwhere you need the parentheses to tell the shell the `:t\\' isn\\'t\njust part of the file name.\nFor a complete list, see the zshexpn manual, or the section\nModifiers in the printed or Info versions of the manual, but here are\na few more of the most useful. `:r\\' removes the suffix of a file,\nturning file.c into file; `:l\\' and `:u\\' make the word(s) all\nlowercase or all uppercase; `:s/foo/bar/\\' substitutes the first\noccurrence of foo with bar in the word(s); `:gs/foo/bar\\'\nsubstitutes all occurrences (the `g\\' stands for global); `:&\\'\nrepeats the last such substitution, even if you did it on a previous\nline; `:g&\\' also works. So\n  % print this is this line\n  this is this line\n  % !!:s/this/that/\n  print that is this line\n  that is this line\n  % print this is no longer this line\n  this is no longer this line\n  % !!:g&\n  print that is no longer that line\n  that is no longer that line\nFinally, there is a shortcut: ^old^new^ is exactly equivalent to\n!!:s/old/new/; you can even put another modifier after it. The `^\\'\nis actually the second character of $histchars mentioned above. You\ncan miss out the last `^\\' if there\\'s nothing else to follow it. By\nthe way, you can put modifiers together, but each one needs the colon\nwith it: :t:r applied to `dir/file.c\\' produces `file\\', and\nrepeated applications of :h get you shorter and shorter paths.\nBefore we leave bang-history, note the option HIST_VERIFY. If that\\'s\nset, then after a substitution the line appears again with the changes,\ninstead of being immediately printed and executed. As you just have to\ntype  to execute it, this is a useful trick to save you executing\nthe wrong thing, which can easily happen with complicated bang-history\nlines; I have this set myself.\nAnd one last tip: the shell\\'s expansion and completion, which I will\nenthuse about at length later on, allows you to expand bang-history\nreferences straight away by hitting TAB immediately after you\\'ve\ntyped the complete reference, and you can usually type control together\nwith slash (on some keyboards, you are restricted to ^Xu) to put it\nback the way it was if you don\\'t like the result --- this is part of\nthe editor\\'s `undo\\' feature.\nKsh-style history commands\\\nThe third form of history uses the fc builtin. It\\'s the most\ncumbersome: you have to tell the command which complete lines to\nexecute, and may be given a chance to edit them first (but using an\nexternal editor, not in the shell). You probably won\\'t use it that way,\nbut there are three things which are actually controlled by fc which\nyou might use: first, the `r\\' command repeats the last command\n(ignoring r\\'s), which is a bit like `!!\\'. Secondly, the command\ncalled `history\\' is also really fc in disguise. It gives you a\nlist of recent commands. They have numbers next to them; you can use\nthese with bang-history instead of using negative numbers to count\nbackward in the way I originally explained, the advantage being they\ndon\\'t change as you enter more commands. You can give ranges of numbers\nto history, the first number for where to start listing, and the\nsecond where to stop: a particular example is `history 1\\', which\nlists all commands (even if the first command it still remembers is\nhigher than 1; it just silently omits all those). The third use of fc\nis for reading and writing your history so you can keep it between\nsessions.\n[]{#l17}\n2.5.4: Setting up history\nIn fact, the shell is able to read and write history without being told.\nYou need to tell it where to save the history, however, and for that you\nhave to set the parameter $HISTFILE to the name of the file you want\nto use (a common choice is `~/.history\\'). Next, you need to set the\nparameter $SAVEHIST to the number of lines of your history you want\nsaved. When these two are set, the shell will read $HISTSIZE lines\nfrom $HISTFILE at the start of an interactive session, and save the\nlast $SAVEHIST lines you executed at the end of the session. For it to\nread or write in the middle, you will either need to set one of the\noptions described below (INC_APPEND_HISTORY and SHARE_HISTORY), or\nuse the fc command: fc -R and fc -W read and write the history\nrespectively, while fc -A appends it to the the file (although pruning\nit if it\\'s longer than $SAVEHIST); fc -WI and fc -AI are similar,\nbut the I means only write out events since the last time history was\nwritten.\nThere is a third parameter $HISTSIZE, which determines the number of\nlines the shell will keep within one session; except for special reasons\nwhich I won\\'t talk about, you should set $SAVEHIST to be no more than\n$HISTSIZE, though it can be less. The default value for $HISTSIZE is\n30, which is a bit stingy for the memory and disk space of today\\'s\ncomputers; zsh users often use anything up to 1000. So a simple set of\nparameters to set in .zshrc is\n  HISTSIZE=1000\n  SAVEHIST=1000\n  HISTFILE=~/.history\nand that is enough to get things working. Note that you must set\n$SAVEHIST and $HISTFILE for automatic reading and writing of history\nlines to work.\n[]{#l18}\n2.5.5: History options\nThere are also many options affecting history; these increased\nsubstantially with version 3.1.6, which provided for the first time\nINC_APPEND_HISTORY, SHARE_HISTORY, HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST,\nHIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS, HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS and HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS. I\nhave already described BANG_HIST, CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY and\nHIST_VERIFY and I won\\'t talk about them again.\nAPPEND_HISTORY, INC_APPEND_HISTORY, SHARE_HISTORY\\\nNormally, when it writes a history file, zsh just overwrites everything\nthat\\'s there. APPEND_HISTORY allows it to append the new history to\nthe old. The shell will make an effort not to write out lines which\nshould be there already; this can get complicated if you have lots of\nzshs running in different windows at once. This option is a good one for\nmost people to use. INC_APPEND_HISTORY means that instead of doing\nthis when the shell exits, each line is added to the history in this way\nas it is executed; this means, for example, that if you start up a zsh\ninside the main shell its history will look like that of the main shell,\nwhich is quite useful. It also means the ordering of commands from\ndifferent shells running at the same time is much more logical ---\nbasically just the order they were executed --- so for 3.1.6 and\nhigher this option is recommended.\nSHARE_HISTORY takes this one stage further: as each line is added, the\nhistory file is checked to see if anything was written out by another\nshell, and if so it is included in the history of the current shell too.\nThis means that zsh\\'s running in different windows but on the same host\n(or more generally with the same home directory) share the same history.\nNote that zsh tries not to confuse you by having unexpected history\nentries pop up: if you use !-style history, the commands from other\nsession don\\'t appear in the history list until you explicitly type the\nhistory command to display them, so that you can be sure what command\nyou are actually reexecuting. The Korn shell always behaves as if\nSHARE_HISTORY is set, presumably because it doesn\\'t store history\ninternally.\nEXTENDED_HISTORY\\\nThis makes the format of the history entry more complicated: in addition\nto just the command, it saves the time when the command was started and\nhow long it ran for. The history command takes three options which use\nthis: history -d prints the start time of the command; history -f\nprints that as well as the date; history -D (which you can combine\nwith -f or -d) prints the command\\'s elapsed time. The date format\ncan be changed with -E for European (day.month.year) and -i\nfor international (year-month-day) formats. The main reasons why\nyou wouldn\\'t want to set this would be shortage of disk space, or\nbecause you wanted your history file to be read by another shell.\nHIST_IGNORE_DUPS, HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS, HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST,\nHIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS, HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS\\\nThese options give ways of dealing with the duplicate lines that often\nappear in the history. The simplest is HIST_IGNORE_DUPS, which tells\nthe shell not to store a history line if it\\'s the same as the previous\none, thus collapsing a lot of repeated commands down to one; this is a\nvery good option to have set. It does nothing when duplicate lines are\nnot adjacent, so for example alternating pairs of commands will always\nbe stored. The next two options can help here: HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS\nsimply removes copies of lines still in the history list, keeping the\nnewly added one, while HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST is more subtle: it\npreferentially removes duplicates when the history fills up, but does\nnothing until then. HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS means that whatever options are\nset for the current session, the shell is not to save duplicated lines\nmore than once; and HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS means that even if duplicate\nlines have been saved, searches backwards with editor commands don\\'t\nshow them more than once.\nHIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER, HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS\\\nThese allow the history mechanism to make changes to lines as they are\nentered. The first affects output redirections, where you use the symbol\n> to redirect the output of a command or set of commands to a named\nfile, or use >``> to append the output to that file. If you have the\nNO_CLOBBER option set, then\n  touch newfile\n  echo hello >newfile\nfails, because the `touch\\' command has created newfile and\nNO_CLOBBER won\\'t let you overwrite (clobber) it in the next line.\nWith HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER, the second line appears in the history as\n  echo hello >|newfile\nwhere the >| overrides NO_CLOBBER. So to get round the NO_CLOBBER\nyou can just go back to the previous line and execute it without editing\nit.\nThe second option, HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS, will tidy up the line when it\nis entered into the history by removing any excess blanks that mean\nnothing to the shell. This can also mean that the line becomes a\nduplicate of a previous one even if it would not have been in its\nuntidied form. It is smart enough not to remove blanks which are\nimportant, i.e. are quoted.\nHIST_IGNORE_SPACE, HIST_NO_STORE, HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS\\\nThese three options allow you to say that certain lines shouldn\\'t go\ninto the history at all. HIST_IGNORE_SPACE means that lines which\nbegin with a space don\\'t go into the history; the idea is that you\ndeliberately type a space, which is not otherwise significant to the\nshell, before entering any line you want to be forgotten immediately\nafterwards. In zsh 4.0.1 this is implemented so that you can always\nrecall the immediately preceding line for editing, even if it had a\nspace; but when the next line is executed and entered into the history,\nthe line beginning with the space is forgotten.\nHIST_NO_STORE tells the shell not to store history or fc commands.\nwhile HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS tells it not to store function definitions as\nthese, though usually infrequent, can be tiresomely long. A function\ndefinition is anything beginning `function funcname {...\\' or\n`funcname () { ...\\'.\nNO_HIST_BEEP\\\nFinally, HIST_BEEP is used in the editor: if you try to scroll up or\ndown beyond the end of the history list, the shell will beep. It is on\nby default, so use NO_HIST_BEEP to turn it off.\n[]{#l19}\n2.5.6: Prompts\nMost people have some definitions in .zshrc for altering the prompt\nyou see at the start of each line. I\\'ve already mentioned\nPROMPT_PERCENT (set by default) and PROMPT_SUBST (unset by default);\nI\\'ll assume here you haven\\'t changed these settings, and point out\nsome of the possibilities with prompt escapes, sequences that start\nwith a `%\\'. If you get really sophisticated, you might need to turn\non PROMPT_SUBST.\nThe main prompt is in a parameter called either $PS1 or $PROMPT or\n$prompt; the reason for having all these names is historical ---\nthey come from different shells --- so I\\'ll just stick with the\nshortest. There is also $RPS1, which prints a prompt at the right of\nthe screen. The point of this is that it automatically disappears if you\ntype so far along the line that you run into it, so it can help make the\nbest use of space for showing long things like directories.\n$PS2 is shown when the shell is waiting for some more input, i.e. it\nknows that what you have typed so far isn\\'t a complete line: it may\ncontain the start of a quoted expression, but not the end, or the start\nof some syntactic structure which is not yet finished. Usually you will\nkeep it different from $PS1, but all the same escapes are understood\nin all five prompts.\n$PS3 is shown within a loop started by the shell\\'s select\nmechanism, when the shell wants you to input a choice: see the zshmisc\nmanual page as I won\\'t say much about that.\n$PS4 is useful in debugging: there is an option XTRACE which causes\nthe shell to print out lines about to be executed, preceded by $PS4.\nOnly from version 3.1.6 has it started to be substituted in the same way\nas the other prompts, though this turns out to be very useful --- see\n`Location in script or function\\' in the following list.\nHere are some of the things you might want to include in your prompts.\nNote that you can try this out before you alter the prompt by using\n`print -P\\': this expands strings just are as they are in prompts.\nYou will probably need to put the string in single quotes.\nThe time\\\nZsh allows you lots of different ways of putting the time into your\nprompt with percent escapes. The simplest are %t and %T, the time in\n12 and 24 hour formats, and %*, the same as %T but with seconds; you\ncan also have the date as (e.g.) `Wed 22\\' using %w, as\n`9/22/99\\' (US format) using %W, or as `99-09-22\\' (International\nformat) using %D. However, there is another way of using %D to get many\nmore possibilities: a following string in braces, `%D{...}\\' can\ncontain a completely different set of percent escapes all of which refer\nto elements of the time and date. On most systems, the documentation for\nthe strftime function will tell you what these are. zsh has a few of\nits own, given in the zshmisc manual page in the PROMPT EXPANSION\nsection. For example, I use %D{%L:%M} which gives the time in hours\nand minutes, with the hours as a single digit for 1 to 9; it looks more\nhomely to my unsophisticated eyes.\nYou can have more fun by using the `%(numX.true.false)\\'\nsyntax, where X is one of t or T. For t, if the time in minutes\nis the same as num (default zero), then true is used as the text for\nthis section of the prompt, while false is used otherwise. T does\nthe same for hours. Hence\n  PS1='%(t.Ding!.%D{%L:%M})%# '\nprints the message `Ding!\\' at zero minutes past the hour, and a more\nconventional time otherwise. The `%#\\' is the standard sequence which\nprints a `#\\' if you are the superuser (root), or a `%\\' for\neveryone else, which occurs in a lot of people\\'s prompts. Likewise, you\ncould use `%(30t.Dong!....\\' for a message at half past the hour.\nThe current directory\\\nThe sequence `%~\\' prints out the directory, with any home or named\ndirectories (see below) shortened to the form starting with ~; the\nsequence `%/\\' doesn\\'t do that shortening, so usually `%~\\' is\nbetter. Directories can be long, and there are various ways to deal with\nit. First, if you are using a windowing system you can put the directory\nin the title bar, rather than anywhere inside the window. Second, you\ncan use $RPS1 which disappears when you type near it. Third, you can\npick segments out of `%~\\' or `%/\\' by giving them a number after\nthe `%\\': for example, `%1~\\' just picks out the last segment of\nthe path to the current directory.\nThe fourth way gives you the most control. Prompts or parts of prompts,\nnot just bits showing the directory, can be truncated to any length you\nchoose. To truncate a path on the left, use something like\n`%10...\\'. That works like this: the `%\\' is the\nbasic form for truncation. The 10 after the `%\\' says that anything\nfollowing is limited to 10 characters, and the characters `...\\' are\nto be displayed whenever the prompt would otherwise be longer than that\n(you can leave this empty). This applies to anything following, so now\nthe %~ can\\'t be longer than 10 characters, otherwise it will be\ntruncated (to 7 characters, once the `...\\' has been printed). You\ncan turn off truncation with `%\\', i.e. no number after the\n`%\\'; truncation then applies to the entire region between where it\nwas turned on and where it was turned off (this has changed from older\nversions of zsh, where it just applied to individual `%\\'\nconstructs).\nWhat are you waiting for?\\\nThe prompt $PS2 appears when the shell is waiting for you to finish\nentering something, and it\\'s useful to know what the shell is waiting\nfor. The sequence `%_\\' shows this. It\\'s part of the default $PS2,\nwhich is `%_>\\'. Hence, if you type `if true; then\\' and ,\nthe prompt will say `then>\\'. You can also use it in the trace\nprompt, $PS4, to show the same information about what is being\nexecuted in a script or function, though as there is usually enough\ninformation there (as described next) it\\'s not part of the default. In\nthis case, a number after the `%\\' will limit the depth shown, so\nwith `%1_\\' only the most recent thing will be mentioned.\nLocation in script or function\\\nThe default $PS4 contains `%N\\' and `%i\\', which tell you the\nname of the most recently started function, script, or sourced file, and\nthe line number being executed inside it; they are not very useful in\nother prompts. However, `%i\\' in $PS1 will tell you the current\ninteractive line number, which zsh keeps track of, though doesn\\'t\nusually show you; the parameter $LINENO contains the same information.\nAnother point to bear about `%i\\' in mind is that the line number\nshown applies to the version of a function first read in, not how it\nappears with the `functions\\' command, which is tidied up. If you use\nautoloaded functions, however, the file containing the function will\nusually be what you want to alter, so this shouldn\\'t be a problem when\ndebugging.\nRemember, the $PS4 display only happens when the XTRACE option is\nset; as options may be local to functions, and always are to scripts,\nyou will often need to put an explicit `setopt xtrace\\' at the top of\nwhatever you are debugging. Alternatively, you can use `typeset -ft\nfuncname\\' to turn on tracing for that function (something I only just\ndiscovered); use `typeset +ft funcname\\' to turn it off again.\nOther bits and pieces\\\nThere are many other percent escapes described in the zshmisc manual\npage, mostly straightforward. For example, `%h\\' shows you the\nhistory entry number, useful if you are using bang-history; `%m\\'\nshows you the current host name up to any dot; `%n\\' shows the\nusername.\nThere are two other features I happen to use myself. First, it\\'s\nsometimes convenient to know when the last command failed. Every command\nreturns a status, which is a number: zero for success, some other number\nfor some type of failure. You can get this from the parameter `$?\\'\nor `$status\\' (again, they refer to the same thing). It\\'s also\navailable in the prompt as `%?\\', and there\\'s also one of the\nso-called `ternary\\' expressions with parentheses I described for time,\nwhich pick different strings depending on a test. Here the test is,\nreasonably enough, `%(?...\\'. Putting these two together, you can\nget a message which is only displayed when the exit status is non-zero;\nI\\'ve put an extra set of parentheses around the number just to make it\nclearer, where the `)\\' needs to be turned into `%)\\' to stop it\nmarking the end of the group:\n  PS1='%(?..(%?%))%# '\nIt\\'s also sometimes convenient to know if you\\'re in a subshell, that\nis if you\\'ve started another shell within the main one by typing\n`zsh\\'. You can do this by using another ternary expression:\n  PS1='%(2L.+.)%# '\nThis checks the parameter SHLVL, which is incremented every time a new\nzsh starts, so if there was already one running (which would have set\nSHLVL to 1), it will now be 2; and if SHLVL is at least 2, an extra\n`+\\' is printed in front of the prompt, otherwise nothing. If you\\'re\nusing a windowing system, you may need to turn the 2 into 3 as there may\nbe a zsh already running when you first log in, so that the shells in\nthe windows have SHLVL set to 2 already. This depends a good deal on\nhow your windowing system is set up; finding out more is left as an\nexercise for the reader.\nColours\\\nMany terminals can now display colours, and it is quite useful to be\nable to put these into prompts to distinguish those from the surrounding\ntext. I often find a programme has just dumped a whole load of output on\nmy terminal and it\\'s not obvious where it starts. Being able to find\nthe prompt just before helps a lot.\nColors, like bold or underlined text, use escape sequences which don\\'t\nmove the cursor. The golden rule for inserting any such escape sequences\ninto prompts is to surround them with `%{\\' at the start and `%}\\'\nat the end. Otherwise, the shell will be confused about the length of\nthe line. This affects what happens when the line editor needs to redraw\nthe line, and also changes the position of the right prompt $RPS1, if\nyou use that. You don\\'t need that with the special sequences %B and\n%b, which start and stop bold text, because the shell already knows\nwhat to do with those; it\\'s only random characters which you happen to\nknow don\\'t move the cursor, though the shell doesn\\'t, that cause the\nproblem.\nIn the case of colours, there is a shell function colors supplied with\nthe standard distribution to help you. When loaded and run, it defines\nassociative array parameters $fg and $bg which you use to extract\nthe escape sequences for given colours, for example\n${fg[red]}${bg[yellow]} produces the sequences for red text on a\nyellow background. So for example,\n  PS1=\"%{${bg[white]}${fg[red]}%}%(?..(%?%))\\ \n  %{${fg[yellow]}${bg[black]}%}%# \"\nproduces a red-on-white `(1)\\' if the previous programme exited with\nstatus 1, but nothing if it exited with status 0, followed by a\nyellow-on-black `%\\' or `#\\' if you are the superuser. Note the\nuse of the double quotes here to force the parameters to be expanded\nstraight away --- the escape sequences are fixed, so they don\\'t need\nto be re-extracted from the parameters every time the prompt is shown.\nEven if your terminal does support colour, there\\'s no guarantee all the\npossibilities work, although the basic ANSI colour scheme is fairly\nstandard. The colours understood are: cyan, white, yellow, magenta,\nblack, blue, red, grey, green. You can also used `default\\', which puts\nthe terminal back how it was to begin with. In addition, you can use the\nbasic colours with the parameters $bg_bold and $fg_bold for bold\nvarieties of the colours and $bg_no_bold and $fg_no_bold to switch\nexplicitly back to non-bold.\nThemes\\\nThere are also a set of themes provided as functions to set up your\nprompt to various predefined possibilities. These make use of the\ncolours set up as described above. See the zshcontrib manual page for\nhow to do this (search for `prompt themes\\').\n[]{#l20}\n2.5.7: Named directories\nAs already mentioned, `~/\\' at the start of a filename expands to\nyour home directory. More generally, `~user/\\' allows you to\nrefer to the home directory of any other user. Furthermore, zsh lets you\ndefine your own named directories which use this syntax. The basic idea\nis simple, since any parameter can be a named directory:\n  dir=/tmp/mydir\n  print ~dir\nprints `/tmp/mydir\\'. So far, this isn\\'t any different from using the\nparameter as $dir. The difference comes if you use the `%~\\'\nconstruct, described above, in your prompt. Then when you change into\nthat directory, instead of seeing the message `/tmp/mydir\\', you will\nsee the abbreviation `~dir\\'.\nThe shell will not register the name of the directory until you force it\nto by using `~dir\\' yourself at least once. You can do the following\nin your .zshrc:\n  dir=/tmp/mydir\n  bin=~/myprogs/bin\n  : ~dir ~bin\nwhere `:\\' is a command that does nothing --- but its arguments are\nchecked for parameters and so on in the usual way, so that the shell can\nput dir and bin into its list of named directories. A more simple\nway of doing this is to set the option AUTO_NAME_DIRS; then any\nparameter created which refers to a directory will automatically be\nturned into a name. The directory must have an absolute path, i.e. its\nexpanded value, after turning any `~\\'s at the start into full paths,\nmust begin with a `/\\'. The parameter $PWD, which shows the current\ndirectory, is protected from being turned into ~PWD, since that would\ntell you nothing.\n[]{#l21}\n2.5.8: `Go faster\\' options for power users\nHere are a few more random options you might want to set in your\n.zshrc.\nNO_BEEP\\\nNormally zsh will beep if it doesn\\'t like something. This can get\nextremely annoying; `setopt nobeep\\' will turn it off. I refer to\nthis informally as the OPEN_PLAN_OFFICE_NO_VIGILANTE_ATTACKS option.\nAUTO_CD\\\nIf this option is set, and you type something with no arguments which\nisn\\'t a command, zsh will check to see if it\\'s actually a directory.\nIf it is, the shell will change to that directory. So `./bin\\' on its\nown is equivalent to `cd ./bin\\', as long as the directory\n`./bin\\' really exists. This is particularly useful in the form\n`..\\', which changes to the parent directory.\nCD_ABLE_VARS\\\nThis is another way of saving typing when changing directory, though\nonly one character. If a directory doesn\\'t exist when you try to change\nto it, zsh will try and find a parameter of that name and use that\ninstead. You can also have a `/\\' and other bits after the parameter.\nSo `cd foo/dir\\', if there is no directory `foo\\' but there is a\nparameter $foo, becomes equivalent to `cd $foo/dir\\'.\nEXTENDED_GLOB\\\nPatterns, to match the name of files and other things, can be very\nsophisticated in zsh, but to get the most out of them you need to use\nthis option, as otherwise certain features are not enabled, so that\npeople used to simpler patterns (maybe just `*\\', `?\\' and\n`[...]\\') are not confused by strange happenings. I\\'ll say much more\nabout zsh\\'s pattern features, but this is to remind you that you need\nthis option if you\\'re doing anything clever with `~\\', `#\\',\n`^\\' or globbing flags --- and also to remind you that those\ncharacters can have strange effects if you have the option set.\nMULTIOS\\\nI mentioned above that to get zsh to behave like ksh you needed to set\nNO_MULTIOS, but I didn\\'t say what the MULTIOS option did. It has\ntwo different effects for output and input.\nFirst, for output. Here it\\'s an alternative to the tee programme.\nI\\'ve mentioned once, but haven\\'t described in detail, that you could\nuse >filename to tell the shell to send output into a file with a\ngiven name instead of to the terminal. With MULTIOS set, you can have\nmore than one of those redirections on the command line:\n  echo foo >file1 >file2\nHere, `foo\\' will be written to both the named files; zsh copies\nthe output. The pipe mechanism, which I\\'ll describe better in chapter\n3, is a sort of redirection into another\nprogramme instead of into a file: MULTIOS affects this as well:\n  echo foo >file1 | sed 's/foo/bar/'\nHere, `foo\\' is again written to file1, but is also sent into the\npipe to the programme sed (`stream editor\\') which substitutes\n`foo\\' into `bar\\' and (since there is no output redirection in\nthis part) prints it to the terminal.\nNote that the second example above has several times been reported as a\nbug, often in a form like:\n some_command 2>&1 >/dev/null | sed 's/foo/bar/'\nThe intention here is presumably to send standard error to standard\noutput (the `2>&1\\', a very commonly used shell hieroglyphic), and\nnot send standard output anywhere (the `>/dev/null\\'). (If you\nhaven\\'t met the concept of `standard error\\', it\\'s just another\noutput channel which goes to the same place as normal output unless you\nredirect it; it\\'s used, for example to send error messages to the\nterminal even if your output is going somewhere else.) In this example,\ntoo, the MULTIOS feature forces the original standard output to go to\nthe pipe. You can see this happening if we put in a version of\n`some_command\\':\n { echo foo error >&2; echo foo not error;  } 2>&1 >/dev/null |\n  sed 's/foo/bar/'\nwhere you can consider the stuff inside the `{...}\\' as a black box\nthat sends the message `foo error\\' to standard error, and `foo not\nerror\\' to standard output. With MULTIOS, however, the result is\n error bar\n  not error bar\nbecause both have been sent into the pipe. Without MULTIOS you get the\nexpected result,\n error bar\nas any other Bourne-style shell would produce. There\nOn input, MULTIOS arranges for a series of files to be read in order.\nThis time it\\'s a bit like using the programme cat, which combines all\nthe files listed after it. In other words,\n  cat file1 file2 | myprog\n(where myprog is some programme that reads all the files sent to it as\ninput) can be replaced by\n  myprog which does the same thing. Once again, a pipe counts as a redirection,\nand the pipe is read from first, before any files listed after a\n`\\':\n  echo then this >testfile\n  echo this first | cat CORRECT, CORRECT_ALL\\\nIf you have CORRECT set, the shell will check all the commands you\ntype and if they don\\'t exist, but there is one with a similar name, it\nwill ask you if you meant that one instead. You can type `n\\' for no,\ndon\\'t correct, just go ahead; `y\\' for yes, correct it then go\nahead; `a\\' for abort, don\\'t do anything; `e\\' for edit, return\nto the editor to edit the same line again. Users of the new completion\nsystem should note this is not the same correction you get there: it\\'s\njust simple correction of commands.\nCORRECT_ALL applies to all the words on the line. It\\'s a little less\nuseful, because currently the shell has to assume that they are supposed\nto be filenames, and will try to correct them if they don\\'t exist as\nsuch, but of course many of the arguments to a command are not\nfilenames. If particular commands generate too many attempts to correct\ntheir arguments, you can turn this off by putting `nocorrect\\' in\nfront of the command name. An alias is a very good way of doing this, as\ndescribed next.\n[]{#l22}\n2.5.9: aliases\nAn alias is used like a command, but it expands into some other text\nwhich is itself used as a command. For example,\n  alias foo='print I said foo'\n  foo\nprints (guess what) `I said foo\\'. Note the syntax for definition\n--- you need the `=\\', and you need to make sure the whole alias is\ntreated by the shell as one word; you can give a whole list of aliases\nto the same `alias\\' command. You may be able to think of some\naliases you want to define in your startup files; .zshrc is probably\nthe right place. If you have CORRECT_ALL set, the way to avoid the\n`mkdir\\' command spell-checking its arguments --- which is useless,\nbecause they have to be non-existent for the command to work --- is\nto define:\n  alias mkdir='nocorrect mkdir'\nThis shows one useful feature about aliases: the alias can contain\nsomething of the same name as itself. When it is encountered in the\nexpansion text (the right hand side), the shell knows it is not to\nexpand the alias again, but this time to treat it as a real command.\nNote that functions do not have this property: functions are more\npowerful than aliases and in some cases it is useful for them to call\nthemselves, It\\'s a common mistake to have functions call themselves\nover and over again until the shell complains. I\\'ll describe ways round\nthis in chapter 3.\nOne other way functions are more powerful than aliases is that functions\ncan take arguments while aliases can\\'t --- in other words, there is\nno way of referring inside the alias to what follows it on the command\nline, unlike a function, and also unlike aliases in csh (because that\nhas no functions, that\\'s why). It is just blindly expanded, and the\nremainder of the command line stuck on the end. Hence aliases in zsh are\nusually kept for quite simple things, and functions are written for\nanything more complicated. You couldn\\'t do that trick with\n`nocorrect\\' using a function, though, since the function is called\ntoo late: aliases are expanded straight away, so the nocorrect is\nfound in time to be useful. You can almost think of them as just plain\ntyping abbreviations.\nNormal aliases only work when in command position, i.e. at the start of\nthe command line (more strictly, when zsh is expecting a command). There\nare other things called `global aliases\\', which you define by the\n`-g\\' option to alias, which will be expanded at any position on\nthe command line. You should think seriously before defining these, as\nthey can have a drastic effect. Note, however, that quoting a word, or\neven a single character, will stop an alias being expanded for it.\nI only tend to use aliases in interactive shells, so I define them from\n.zshrc, but you may want to use .zshenv if you use aliases more\nwidely. In fact, to keep my .zshrc neat I save all the aliases in a\nseparate file called .aliasrc and in .zshrc I have:\n  if [[ -r ~/.aliasrc ]]; then\n    . ~/.aliasrc\n  fi\nwhich checks if there is a readable file ~/.aliasrc, and if there is,\nit runs it in exactly the same way the normal startup files are run. You\ncan use `source\\' instead of `.\\' if it means more to you; `.\\'\nis the traditional Bourne and Korn shell name, however.\n[]{#l23}\n2.5.10: Environment variables\nOften, the manual for a programme will tell you to define certain\nenvironment variables, usually a collection of uppercase letters with\nmaybe numbers and the odd underscore. These can pass information to the\nprogramme without you needing to use extra arguments. In zsh,\nenvironment variables appear as ordinary shell parameters, although they\nhave to be defined slightly differently: strictly, the environment is a\nspecial region outside the shell, and zsh has to be told to put a copy\nthere as well as keeping one of its own. The usual syntax is\n  export VARNAME='value'\nin other words, like an ordinary assignment, but with `export\\' in\nfront. Note there is no `$\\' before the name of the environment\nvariable; all `export\\' and similar statements work the same way. The\neasiest place to put these is in .zshenv --- hence it\\'s name.\nEnvironment variables will be passed to any programmes run from a shell,\nso it may be enough to define them in .zlogin or .zprofile: however,\nany shell started for you non-interactively won\\'t run those, and there\nare other possible problems if you use a windowing system which is\nstarted by a shell other than zsh or which doesn\\'t run a shell start-up\nfile at all --- I had to tweak mine to make it do so. So .zshenv is\nthe safest place; it doesn\\'t take long to define environment variables.\nOther people will no doubt give you completely contradictory views, but\nthat\\'s people for you.\nNote that you can\\'t export arrays. If you export a parameter, then\nassign an array to it, nothing will appear in the environment; you can\nuse the external command `printenv VARNAME\\' (again no `$\\'\nbecause the command needs to know the name, not the value) to check.\nThere\\'s a more subtle problem with arrays, too. The export builtin is\njust a special case of the builtin typeset, which defines a variable\nwithout marking it for export to the environment. You might think you\ncould do\n  typeset array=(this doesn\\'t work)\nbut you can\\'t --- the special array syntax is only understood when\nthe assignment does not follow a command, not in normal arguments like\nthe case here, so you have to put the array assignment on the next line.\nThis is a very easy mistake to make. More uses of typeset will be\ndescribed in chapter 3; they include creating\nlocal parameters in functions, and defining special attributes (of which\nthe `export\\' attribute is just one) for parameters.\n[]{#l24}\n2.5.11: Path\nIt helps to be able to find external programmes, i.e. anything not part\nof the shell, any command other than a builtin, function or alias. The\n$path array is used for this. Actually, what the system needs is the\nenvironment variable $PATH, which contains a list of directories in\nwhich to search for programmes, separated from each other by a colon.\nThese directories are the individual components of the array $path. So\nif $path contains\n  path=(/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin .)\nthen $PATH will automatically contain the effect of\n  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:.\nwithout you having to set that. The idea is simply that, while the\nsystem needs $PATH because it doesn\\'t understand arrays, it\\'s much\nmore flexible to be able to use arrays within the shell and hence pretty\nmuch forget about the $PATH form.\nChanges to the path are similar to changes to environment variables\ndescribed above, so all that applies. There\\'s a slight difficulty in\nsetting $path in .zshenv however, even though the reasons given\nabove for doing so still apply. Usually, the path will be set for you,\neither by the system, or by the system administrator in one of the\nglobal start up files, and if you change path you will simply want to\nadd to it. But if your .zshenv contains\n  path=(~/bin ~/progs/bin $path)\n--- which is the right way of adding something to the front of $path\n--- then every time .zshenv is called, ~/bin and ~/progs/bin are\nstuck in front, so if you start another zsh you will have two sets\nthere.\nYou can add tests to see if something\\'s already there, of course. Zsh\nconveniently allows you to test for the existence of elements in an\narray. By preceding an array index by (r) (for reverse), it will try\nto find a matching element and return that, else an empty string.\nHere\\'s a way of doing that (but don\\'t add this yet, see the next\nparagraph):\n  for dir in ~/bin ~/progs/bin; do\n    if [[ -z ${path[(r)$dir]} ]]; then\n      path=($dir $path)\n    fi \n  done\nThat for... do ... done is another special shell construct. It\ntakes each thing after `in\\' and assigns it in turn to the parameter\nnamed before the `in\\' --- $dir, but because this is a form of\nassignment, the `$\\' is left off --- so the first time round it has\nthe effect of dir=~/bin, and the next time dir=~/progs/bin. Then it\nexecutes what\\'s in the loop. The test -z checks that what follows is\nempty: in this case it will be if the directory $dir is not yet in\n$path, so it goes ahead and adds it in front. Note that the\ndirectories get added in the reverse of the order they appear.\nActually, however, zsh takes all that trouble away from you. The\nincantation `typeset -U path\\', where the -U stands for unique,\ntells the shell that it should not add anything to $path if it\\'s\nthere already. To be precise, it keeps only the left-most occurrence, so\nif you added something at the end it will disappear and if you added\nsomething at the beginning, the old one will disappear. Thus the\nfollowing works nicely in .zshenv:\n  typeset -U path\n  path=(~/bin ~/progs/bin $path)\nand you can put down that `for\\' stuff as a lesson in shell\nprogramming. You can list all the variables which have uniqueness turned\non by typing `typeset +U\\', with `+\\' instead of `-\\', because\nin the latter case the shell would show the values of the parameters as\nwell, which isn\\'t what you need here. The -U flag will also work with\ncolon-separated arrays, like $PATH.\n[]{#l25}\n2.5.12: Mail\nZsh will check for new mail for you. If all you need is to be reminded\nof something arriving in your normal folder every now and then, you just\nneed to set the parameter $MAIL to wherever that is: it\\'s typically\none of /usr/spool/mail, /var/spool/mail, or /var/mail.\nThe array $mailpath allows more possibilities. Like $path, it has a\ncolleague in uppercase, $MAILPATH, which is a colon-separated array.\nThe system doesn\\'t need that, this time, so it\\'s mainly there so that\nyou can export it to another version of zsh; exporting arrays won\\'t\nwork. As may by now be painfully clear, if you set in .zshenv or\n.zshrc, you don\\'t need to export it, because it\\'s set in each\ninstance of the shell. The elements of $mailpath work like $MAIL, so\nyou can specify different places where mail arrives. That\\'s most useful\nif you have a programme like filter or procmail running to\nredistribute arriving mail to different folders. You can specify a\ndifferent message for each folder by putting `?message\\' at the\nend. For example, mine looks like this.\n  mailpref=/temp/pws/Mail\n  mailpath=($mailpref/newmail\n            $mailpref/zsh-new'?New zsh mail' \n            $mailpref/list-new'?New list mail'\n            $mailpref/urth-new'?New Urth mail')\nNote that zsh knows the array isn\\'t finished until the `)\\', even\nthough the elements are on different lines; this is one very good reason\nfor setting $mailpath rather than $MAILPATH, which needs one long\nchunk.\nThe other parameter of interest is $MAILCHECK, which gives the\nfrequency in seconds when zsh should check for new mail. The default is\n\nActually, zsh only checks just after a command has finished running\nand it is about to print a prompt. Since checking files doesn\\'t take\nlong, you can usually set this to its minimum value, which is\nMAILCHECK=1; zero doesn\\'t work because it switches off checking. One\nreason why you wouldn\\'t want to do that might be because $MAIL and\n$mailpath can contain directories instead of ordinary files; these\nwill be checked recursively for any files with something new in them, so\nthis can be slow.\n\nFinally, there is one associated option, MAIL_WARNING (though\nMAIL_WARN is also accepted for the same thing for reasons of\ncompatibility with less grammatical shells). The shell remembers when it\nfound the mail file was checked; next time it checks, it compares the\ndate. If there is no new mail, but the date of the file changed anyway,\nit will print a warning message. This will happen if you read the mail\nwith your mail reader and put the messages somewhere else. Presumably\nyou know you did that, so the warning may not be all that useful.\n[]{#l26}\n2.5.13: Other path-like things\nThere are other pairs like $path and $PATH. I will keep back talk of\n$cdpath until I say more about the way zsh handles directories. When I\nmentioned $fpath, I didn\\'t say there was also $FPATH, but there is.\nThen there is $manpath and $MANPATH; these aren\\'t used by the shell\nat all, but $MANPATH, if exported, is used by the man external\ncommand, and $manpath gives an easier way to set it.\nFrom 3.1.6 there is a mechanism to define your own such combinations; if\nthis had been available before, there would have been no need to build\nin $manpath and $MANPATH. In .zshenv you would put,\n  export -TU TEXINPUTS texinputs\nto define such a pair. The -T (for tie) is the key to that; I\\'ve used\n`export\\' even though the basic variable declaration command is\n`typeset\\' because you nearly always want to get the colon-separated\nversion ($TEXINPUTS here) visible to the environment, and I\\'ve set\n-U as described above for $path because it\\'s a neat feature anyway.\nNow you can assign to the array $texinputs and let the programme (TeX\nor its derivatives) see $TEXINPUTS. Another useful variable to do this\nwith is $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which on most modern versions of UNIX (and\nLinux) tells the system where to find the libraries which provide extra\nfunctions when it runs a programme.\n[]{#l27}\n2.5.14: Version-specific things\nSince zsh changes faster than almost any other command interpreter known\nto humankind, you will often find you need to find out what version you\nare using. This can get a bit verbose; indeed, the parameter you need to\ncheck, which is now $ZSH_VERSION, used simply to be called $VERSION\nbefore version 3.0. If you are not using legacy software of that kind,\nyou can probably get away with tests like this:\n  if [[ $ZSH_VERSION == 3.1.* ||\n        $ZSH_VERSION == 3.* ||\n        $ZSH_VERSION == * ]]; then\n    # set feature which appeared first in 3.1.5\n  fi\nIt\\'s like that to be futureproof: it says that if this is a 3.1\nrelease, it has to be at least 3.1.5, but any 3.2 release (there\nweren\\'t any), or any release 4 or later, will also be OK. The\n`\\' etc. are advanced pattern matching tests: pattern matching\nuses the same symbols as globbing, but to test other things, here\nwhat\\'s on the left of the `==\\'. This one matches any number which\nis at least 5, for example 6 or 10 or 252, but not 1 or 4. There are\nalso development releases; nowadays the version numbers look like\nX.Y.Z-tag-N (tag is some short word, the others are\nnumbers) but unless you\\'re keeping up with development you won\\'t need\nto look for those, since they aren\\'t released officially. That `==\\'\nin the test could also be just `=\\', but the manual says the former\nis preferred, so I\\'ve used them here, even though people usually don\\'t\nbother.\nVersion 4 of zsh provides a function is-at-least to do this for you:\nit looks only at the numbers X, Y and Z (and N if it exists),\nignoring all letters and punctuation. You give it the minimum version of\nthe shell you need and it returns true if the current shell is recent\nenough. For example, `is-at-least 3.1.6-pws-9\\' will return true if\nthe current version of zsh is 3.1.6-dev-20 (or 3.1.9, or 4.0.1, and so\non), which is the correct behaviour. As with any other shell function,\nyou have to arrange for is-at-least to be autoloaded if you want to\nuse it.\n[]{#l28}\n2.5.15: Everything else\nThere are many other possibilities for things to go in startup files; in\nparticular, I haven\\'t touched on defining things for the line editor\nand setting up completion. There\\'s quite a lot to explain for those, so\nI\\'ll come back to those in the appropriate chapters. You just need to\nremember that all that stuff should go in .zshrc, since you need it\nfor all interactive shells, and for no others.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide03.html":{"url":"zshguide03.html","title":"章节 3","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n[]{#syntax}[]{#l29}\nChapter 3: Dealing with basic shell syntax\nThis chapter is a more thorough examination of much of what appeared in\nthe chapter 2; to be more specific, I assume\nyou\\'re sitting in front of your terminal about to use the features you\njust set up in your initialisation files and want to know enough to get\nthem going. Actually, you will probably spend most of the time editing\ncommand lines and in particular completing commands --- both of these\nactivities are covered in later chapters. For now I\\'m going to talk\nabout commands and the syntax that goes along with using them. This will\nlet you write shell functions and scripts to do more of your work for\nyou.\nIn the following there are often several consecutive paragraphs about\nquite minor features. If you find you read this all through the first\ntime, maybe you need to get out more. Most people will probably find it\nbetter to skim through to find what the subject matter is, then come\nback if they later find they want to know more about a particular aspect\nof the shell\\'s commands and syntax.\nOne aspect of the syntax is left to chapter 5:\nthere\\'s just so much to it, and it can be so useful if you know enough\nto get it right, that it can\\'t all be squashed in here. The subject is\nexpansion, covering a multitude of things such as parameter expansion,\nglobbing and history expansions. You\\'ve already met the basics of these\nin chapter 2; but if you want to know how to\npick a particular file with a globbing expression with pinpoint\naccuracy, or how to make a single parameter expansion reduce a long\nexpression to the words you need, you should read that chapter; it\\'s\nmore or less self-contained, so you don\\'t necessarily need to know\neverything in this one.\nWe start with the most basic issue in any command line interpreter,\nrunning commands. As you know, you just type words separated by spaces,\nwhere the first word is a command and the remainder are arguments to it.\nIt\\'s important to distinguish between the types of command.\n[]{#l30}\n3.1: External commands\nExternal commands are the easiest, because they have the least\ninteraction with the shell --- many of the commands provided by the\nshell itself, which are described in the next section, are built into\nthe shell especially to avoid this difficulty.\nThe only major issue is therefore how to find them. This is done through\nthe parameters $path and $PATH, which, as I described in chapter\n2, are tied together because although the first\none is more useful inside the shell --- being an array, its various\nparts can be manipulated separately --- the second is the one that is\nused by other commands called by the shell; in the jargon, $PATH is\n`exported to the environment\\', which means exactly that other commands\ncalled by the shell can see its value.\nSo suppose your $path contains\n  /home/pws/bin /usr/local/bin /bin /usr/bin\nand you try to run `ls\\'. The shell first looks in /home/pws/bin\nfor a command called ls, then in /usr/local/bin, then in /bin,\nwhere it finds it, so it executes /bin/ls. Actually, the operating\nsystem itself knows about paths if you execute a command the right way,\nso the shell doesn\\'t strictly need to.\nThere is a subtlety here. The shell tries to remember where the commands\nare, so it can find them again the next time. It keeps them in a\nso-called `hash table\\', and you find the word `hash\\' all over the\nplace in the documentation: all it means is a fast way of finding some\nvalue, given a particular key. In this case, given the name of a\ncommand, the shell can find the path to it quickly. You can see this\ntable, in the form `key=value\\', by typing `hash\\'.\nIn fact the shell only does this when the option HASH_CMDS is set, as\nit is by default. As you might expect, it stops searching when it finds\nthe directory with the command it\\'s looking for. There is an extra\noptimisation in the option HASH_ALL, also set by default: when the\nshell scans a directory to find a command, it will add all the other\ncommands in that directory to the hash table. This is sensible because\non most UNIX-like operating systems reading a whole lot of files in the\nsame directory is quite fast.\nThe way commands are stored has other consequences. In particular, zsh\nwon\\'t look for a new command if it already knows where to find one. If\nI put a new ls command in /usr/local/bin in the above example, zsh\nwould continue to use /bin/ls (assuming it had already been found). To\nfix this, there is the command rehash, which actually empties the\ncommand hash table, so that finding commands starts again from scratch.\nUsers of csh may remember having to type rehash quite a lot with new\ncommands: it\\'s not so bad in zsh, because if no command was already\nhashed, or the existing one disappeared, zsh will automatically scan the\npath again; furthermore, zsh performs a rehash of its own accord if\n$path is altered. So adding a new duplicate command somewhere towards\nthe head of $path is the main reason for needing rehash.\nOne thing that can happen if zsh hasn\\'t filled its command hash table\nand so doesn\\'t know about all external commands is that the AUTO_CD\noption, mentioned in the previous chapter and again below, can think you\nare trying to change to a particular directory with the same name as the\ncommand. This is one of the drawbacks of AUTO_CD.\nTo be a little bit more technical, it\\'s actually not so obvious that\ncommand hashing is needed at all; many modern operating systems can find\ncommands quickly without it. The clincher in the case of zsh is that the\nsame hash table is necessary for command completion, a very commonly\nused feature. If you type `compr\\', the shell completes this to\n`compress\\'. It can only do this if it has a list of commands to\ncomplete, and this is the hash table. (In this case it didn\\'t need to\nknow where to find the command, just its name, but it\\'s only a little\nextra work to store that too.) If you were following the previous\nparagraphs, you\\'ll realise zsh doesn\\'t necessarily know all the\npossible commands at the time you hit TAB, because it only looks when\nit needs to. For this purpose, there is another option, HASH_LIST_ALL,\nagain set by default, which will make sure the command hash table is\nfull when you try to complete a command. It only needs to do this once\n(unless you alter $path), but it does mean the first command\ncompletion is slow. If HASH_LIST_ALL is not set, command completion is\nnot available: the shell could be rewritten to search the path\nlaboriously every single time you try to complete a command name, but it\njust doesn\\'t seem worth it.\nThe fact that $PATH is passed on from the shell to commands called\nfrom it (strictly only if the variable is marked for export, as it\nusually is --- this is described in more detail with the typeset\nfamily of builtin commands below) also has consequences. Some commands\ncall subcommands of their own using $PATH. If you have that set to\nsomething unusual, so that some of the standard commands can\\'t be\nfound, it could happen that a command which is found nonetheless\ndoesn\\'t run properly because it\\'s searching for something it can\\'t\nfind in the path passed down to it. That can lead to some strange and\nconfusing error messages.\nOne important thing to remember about external commands is that the\nshell continues to exist while they are running; it just hangs around\ndoing nothing, waiting for the job to finish (though you can tell it not\nto, as we\\'ll see). The command is given a completely new environment in\nwhich to run; changes in that don\\'t affect the shell, which simply\nstarts up where it left off after the command has run. So if you need to\ndo something which changes the state of the shell, an external command\nisn\\'t good enough. This brings us to builtin commands.\n[]{#l31}\n3.2: Builtin commands\nBuiltin commands, or builtins for short, are commands which are part of\nthe shell itself. Since builtins are necessary for controlling the\nshell\\'s own behaviour, introducing them actually serves as an\nintroduction to quite a lot of what is going on in the shell. So a fair\nfraction of what would otherwise appear later in the chapter has\naccumulated here, one way or another. This does make things a little\ntricksy in places; count how many times I use the word `subtle\\' and\nkeep it for your grandchildren to see.\nI just described one reason for builtins, but there\\'s a simpler one:\nspeed. Going through the process of setting up an entirely new\nenvironment for the command at the beginning, swapping between this\ncommand and anything else which is being run on the computer, then\ndestroying it again at the end is considerable overkill if all you want\nto do is, say, print out a message on the screen. So there are builtins\nfor this sort of thing.\n[]{#l32}\n3.2.1: Builtins for printing\nThe commands `echo\\' and `print\\' are shell builtins; they just\nshow what you typed, after the shell has removed all the quoting. The\ndifference between the two is really historical: `echo\\' came first,\nand only handled a few simple options; ksh provided `print\\', which\nhad more complex options and so became a different command. The\ndifference remains between the two commands in zsh; if you want wacky\neffects, you should look to print. Note that there is usually also an\nexternal command called echo, which may not be identical to zsh\\'s;\nthere is no standard external command called print, but if someone has\ninstalled one on your system, the chances are it sends something to the\nprinter, not the screen.\nOne special effect is `print -z\\' puts the arguments onto the editing\nbuffer stack, a list maintained by the shell of things you are about to\nedit. Try:\n  print -z print -z print This is a line\n(it may look as if something needs quoting, but it doesn\\'t) and hit\nreturn three times. The first time caused everything after the first\n`print -z\\' to appear for you to edit, and so on.\nFor something more useful, you can write functions that give you a line\nto edit:\n  fn() { print -z print The time now is $(date); }\nNow when you type `fn\\', the line with the date appears on the\ncommand line for you to edit. The option `-s\\' is a bit similar; the\nline appears in the history list, so you will see it if you use\nup-arrow, but it doesn\\'t reappear automatically.\nA few other useful options, some of which you\\'ve already seen, are\n-r\n:   don\\'t interpret special character sequences like `\\n\\'\n-P\n:   use `%\\' as in prompts\n-n\n:   don\\'t put a newline at the end in case there\\'s more output to\n    follow\n-c\n:   print the output in columns --- this means that `print -c *\\'\n    has the effect of a sort of poor person\\'s `ls\\', only faster\n-l\n:   use one line per argument instead of one column, which is sometimes\n    useful for sticking lists into files, and for working out what part\n    of an array parameter is in each element.\nIf you don\\'t use the -r option, there are a whole lot of special\ncharacter sequences. Many of these may be familiar to you from C.\n\\n\n:   newline\n\\t\n:   tab\n\\e or \\E\n:   escape character\n\\a\n:   ring the bell (alarm), usually a euphemism for a hideous beep\n\\b\n:   move back one character.\n\\c\n:   don\\'t print a newline --- like the -n option, but embedded in\n    the string. This alternative comes from Berkeley UNIX.\n\\f\n:   form feed, the phrase for `advance to next page\\' from the days\n    when terminals were called teletypes, maybe more familiar to you as\n    ^L\n\\r\n:   carriage return --- when printed, the annoying ^M\\'s you get in\n    DOS files, but actually rather useful with `print\\', since it\n    will erase everything to the start of the line. The combination of\n    the -n option and a \\r at the start of the print string can give\n    the illusion of a continuously changing status line.\n\\v\n:   vertical tab, which I for one have never used (I just tried it now\n    and it behaved like a newline, only without assuming a carriage\n    return, but that\\'s up to your terminal).\nIn fact, you can get any of the 255 characters possible, although your\nterminal may not like some or all of the ones above 127, by specifying a\nnumber after the backslash. Normally this consists of three octal\ncharacters, but you can use two hexadecimal characters after \\x\ninstead --- so `\\n\\', `\\012\\' and `\\x0a\\' are all newlines.\n`\\\\' itself escapes any other character, i.e. they appear as\nthemselves even if they normally wouldn\\'t.\nTwo notes: first, don\\'t get confused because `n\\' is the fourteenth\nletter of the alphabet; printing `\\016\\' (fourteen in octal) won\\'t\ndo you any good. The remedy, after you discover your text is unreadable\n(for VT100-like terminals including xterm), is to print `\\017\\'.\nSecondly, those backslashes can land you in real quoting difficulties.\nNormally a backslash on the command line escapes the next character\n--- this is a different form of escaping to print\\'s --- so\n  print \\n\ndoesn\\'t produce a newline, it just prints out an `n\\'. So you need\nto quote that. This means\n  print \\\\\npasses a single backslash to quote, and\n  print \\\\n\nor\n  print '\\n'\nprints a newline (followed by the extra one that\\'s usually there). To\nprint a real backslash, you would thus need\n  print \\\\\\\\\nActually, you can get away with the two if there\\'s nothing else after\n--- print just shrugs its shoulders and outputs what it\\'s been\ngiven --- but that\\'s not a good habit to get into. There are other\nways of doing this: since single quotes quote anything, including\nbackslashes (they are the only way of making backslashes behave like\nnormal characters), and since the `-r\\' option makes print treat\ncharacters normally,\n  print -r '\\'\nhas the same effect. But you need to remember the two levels of quoting\nfor backslashes. Quotes aren\\'t special to print, so\n  print \\'\nis good enough for printing a quote.\nechotc\\\nThere\\'s an oddity called `echotc\\', which takes as its argument\n`termcap\\' capabilities. This now lives in its own module,\nzsh/termcap.\nTermcap is a now rather old-fashioned way of giving the commands\nnecessary for performing various standard operations on terminals:\nmoving the cursor, clearing to the end of the line, turning on standout\nmode, and so on. It has now been replaced almost everywhere by\n`terminfo\\', a completely different way of specifying capabilities, and\nby `curses\\', a more advanced system for manipulating objects on a\ncharacter terminal. This means that the arguments you need to give to\nechotc can be rather hard to come by; try the termcap manual page;\nif there are two, it\\'s probably the one in section five which gives the\ncodes, i.e. `man 5 zsh\\' or `man -s 5 zsh\\' on Solaris. Otherwise\nyou\\'ll have to search the web. The reason the zsh manual doesn\\'t\ngive a list is that the shell only uses a few well-known sequences, and\nthere are very many others which will work with echotc, because the\nsequences are interpreted by a the terminal, not the shell.\nThis chunk gives you a flavour:\n  zmodload -i zsh/termcap\n  echotc md\n  echo -n bold\n  echotc mr\n  echo -n reverse\n  echotc me\n  echo\nFirst we make sure the module is loaded into the shell; on some older\noperating systems, this only works if it was compiled in when zsh was\ninstalled. The option -i to zmodload stops the shell from\ncomplaining if the module was already loaded. This is a sensible way of\nensuring you have the right facilities available in a shell function,\nsince loading a module makes it available until it is explicitly\nunloaded.\nYou should see `bold\\' in bold characters, and `reverse\\' in bold\nreverse video. The `md\\' capability turns on bold mode; `mr\\'\nturns on reverse video; `me\\' turns off both modes. A more typical\nzsh way of doing this is:\n  print -P '%Bbold%Sreverse%b%s'\nwhich should show the same thing, but using prompt escapes --- prompts\nare the most common use of special fonts. The `%S\\' is because zsh\ncalls reverse `standout\\' mode, because it does. (On a colour xterm,\nyou may find `bold\\' is interpreted as `blue\\'.)\nThere\\'s a lot more you can do with echotc if you really try. The\nshell has just acquired a way of printing terminfo sequences,\npredictably called echoti, although it\\'s only available on systems\nwhere zsh needs terminfo to compile --- this happens when the termcap\ncode is actually a part of terminfo. The good news about this is that\nterminfo tends to be better documented, so you have a good chance of\nfinding out the capabilities you want from the terminfo manual page.\nThe echoti command lives in another predictably named module,\nzsh/terminfo.\n[]{#l33}\n3.2.2: Other builtins just for speed\nThere are only a few other builtins which are there just to make things\ngo faster. Strictly, tests could go into this category, but as I\nexplained in the last chapter it\\'s useful to have tests in the form\n  if [[ $var1 = $var2 ]]; then\n    print doing something\n  fi\nbe treated as a special syntax by the shell, in case $var1 or $var2\nexpands to nothing which would otherwise confuse it. This example\nconsists of two features described below: the test itself, between the\ndouble square brackets, which is true if the two substituted values are\nthe same string, and the `if\\' construct which runs the commands in\nthe middle (here just the print) if that test was true.\nThe builtins `true\\' and `false\\' do nothing at all, except return\na command status zero or one, respectively. They\\'re just used as\nplaceholders: to run a loop forever --- while will also be explained\nin more detail later --- you use\n  while true; do\n    print doing something over and over\n  done\nsince the test always succeeds.\nA synonym for `true\\' is `:\\'; it\\'s often used in this form to\ngive arguments which have side effects but which shouldn\\'t be used\n--- something like\n  : ${param:=value}\nwhich is a common idiom in all Bourne shell derivatives. In the\nparameter expansion, $param is given the value value if it was empty\nbefore, and left alone otherwise. Since that was the only reason for the\nparameter expansion, you use : to ignore the argument. Actually, the\nshell blithely builds the command line --- the colon, followed by\nwhatever the value of $param is, whether or not the assignment\nhappened --- then executes the command; it just so happens that\n`:\\' takes no notice of the arguments it was given. If you\\'re\nswitching from ksh, you may expect certain synonyms like this to be\naliases, rather than builtins themselves, but in zsh they are actually\nbuiltins; there are no aliases predefined by the shell. (You can still\nget rid of them using `disable\\', as described below.)\n[]{#l34}\n3.2.3: Builtins which change the shell\\'s state\nA more common use for builtins is that they change something inside the\nshell, or report information about what\\'s going on in the shell. There\nis one vital thing to remember about external commands. It applies, too,\nto other cases we\\'ll meet where the shell `forks\\', literally\nsplitting itself into two parts, where the forked-off part behaves just\nlike an external command. In both of these cases, the command is in a\ndifferent process, UNIX\\'s basic unit of things that run. (In fact,\neven Windows knows about processes nowadays, although they interact a\nlittle bit differently with one another.)\nThe vital thing is that no change in a separate process started by the\nshell affects the shell itself. The most common case of this is the\ncurrent directory --- every process has its own current directory. You\ncan see this by starting a new zsh:\n  % pwd               # show the current directory\n  ~\n  % zsh               # start a new shell, which \n                      # is a separate process\n  % cd tmp\n  % pwd               # now I'm in a different\n                      # directory...\n  ~/tmp\n  % exit              # leave the new shell...\n  % pwd               # now I'm back where I was...\n  ~\nHence the cd command must be a shell builtin, or this would happen\nevery time you ran it.\nHere\\'s a more useful example. Putting parentheses around a command asks\nthe shell to start a different process for it. That\\'s useful when you\nspecifically don\\'t want the effects propagating back:\n  (cd some-other-dir; run-some-command)\nruns the command, but doesn\\'t change the directory the `real\\' shell\nis in, only its forked-off `subshell\\'. Hence,\n  % pwd\n  ~\n  % (cd /; pwd)\n  /\n  % pwd\n  ~\nThere\\'s a more subtle case:\n  cd some-other-dir | print Hello\nRemember, the `|\\' (`pipe\\') connects the output of the first\ncommand to the input of the next --- though actually no information is\npassed that way in this example. In zsh, all but the last portion of the\n`pipeline\\' thus created is run in different processes. Hence the cd\ndoesn\\'t affect the main shell. I\\'ll refer to it as the `parent\\'\nshell, which is the standard UNIX language for processes; when you start\nanother command or fork off a subshell, you are creating `children\\'\n(without meaning to be morbid, the children usually die first in this\ncase). Thus, as you would guess,\n  print Hello | cd some-other-dir\ndoes have the effect of changing the directory. Note that other shells\ndo this differently; it is always guaranteed to work this way in zsh,\nbecause many people rely on it for setting parameters, but many shells\nhave the left hand of the pipeline being the bit that runs in the\nparent shell. If both sides of the pipe symbol are external commands of\nsome sort, both will of course run in subprocesses.\nThere are other ways you change the state of the shell, for example by\ndeclaring parameters of a particular type, or by telling it how to\ninterpret certain commands, or, of course, by changing options. Here are\nthe most useful, grouped in a vaguely logical fashion.\n[]{#l35}\n3.2.4: cd and friends\nYou will not by now be surprised to learn that the `cd\\' command\nchanges directory. There is a synonym, `chdir\\', which as far as I\nknow no-one ever uses. (It\\'s the same name as the system call, so if\nyou had been programming in C or Perl and forgot that you were now using\nthe shell, you might use `chdir\\'. But that seems a bit far-fetched.)\nThere are various extra features built into cd and chdir. First, if\nyou miss out the directory to which you want to change, you will be\ntaken to your home directory, although it\\'s not as if `cd ~\\' is all\nthat hard to type.\nNext, the command `cd -\\' is special: it takes you to the last\ndirectory you were in. If you do a sequence of cd commands, only the\nimmediately preceding directory is remembered; they are not stacked up.\nThirdly, there is a shortcut for changing between similarly named\ndirectories. If you type `cd  \\', then the shell will look\nfor the first occurrence of the string `\\' in the current\ndirectory, and try to replace it with `\\'. For example,\n  % pwd\n  ~/src/zsh-3.0.8/Src\n  % cd 0.8 1.9\n  ~/src/zsh-3.1.9/Src\nThe cd command actually reported the new directory, as it usually does\nif it\\'s not entirely obvious where it\\'s taken you.\nNote that only the first match of  is taken. It\\'s an easy\nmistake to think you can change from\n/home/export1/pws/mydir1/something to\n/home/export1/pws/mydir2/something with `cd 1 2\\', but that first\n`1\\' messes it up. Arguably the shell could be smarter here. Of\ncourse, `cd r1 r2\\' will work in this case.\ncd\\'s friend `pwd\\' (print working directory) tells you what the\ncurrent working directory is; this information is also available in the\nshell parameter $PWD, which is special and automatically updated when\nthe directory changes. Later, when you know all about expansion, you\nwill find that you can do tricks with this to refer to other\ndirectories. For example, ${PWD/old/new} uses the parameter\nsubstitution mechanism to refer to a different directory with old\nreplaced by new --- and this time old can be a pattern, i.e.\nsomething with wildcard matches in it. So if you are in the\nzsh-3.0.8/Src directory as above and want to copy a file from the\nzsh-3.1.9/Src directory, you have a shorthand:\n  cp ${PWD/0.8/1.9}/myfile.c .\nSymbolic links\\\nZsh tries to track directories across symbolic links. If you\\'re not\nfamiliar with these, you can think of them as a filename which behaves\nlike a pointer to another file (a little like Windows\\' shortcuts,\nthough UNIX has had them for much longer and they work better). You\ncreate them like this (ln is not a builtin command, but its use to\nmake symbolic links is very standard these days):\n  ln -s existing-file-name name-of-link\nfor example\n  ln -s /usr/bin/ln ln\ncreates a file called ln in the current directory which does nothing\nbut point to the file /usr/bin/ln. Symbolic links are very good at\nbehaving as much like the original file as you usually want; for\nexample, you can run the ln link you\\'ve just created as if it were\n/usr/bin/ln. They show up differently in a long file listing with\n`ls -l\\', the last column showing the file they point to.\nYou can make them point to any sort of file at all, including\ndirectories, and that is why they are mentioned here. Suppose you create\na symbolic link from your home directory to the root directory and\nchange into it:\n  ln -s / ~/mylink\n  cd ~/mylink\nIf you don\\'t know it\\'s a link, you expect to be able to change to the\nparent directory by doing `cd ..\\'. However, the operating system\n--- which just has one set of directories starting from / and going\ndown, and ignores symbolic links after it has followed them, they really\nare just pointers --- thinks you are in the root directory /. This\ncan be confusing. Hence zsh tries to keep track of where you probably\nthink you are, rather than where the system does. If you type `pwd\\',\nyou will see `/home/you/mylink\\' (wherever your home directory is),\nnot `/\\'; if you type `cd ..\\', you will find yourself back in\nyour home directory.\nYou can turn all this second-guessing off by setting the option\nCHASE_LINKS; then `cd ~/mydir; pwd\\' will show you to be in /,\nwhere changing to the parent directory has no effect; the parent of the\nroot directory is the root directory, except on certain slightly\npsychedelic networked file systems. This does have advantages: for\nexample, `cd ~/mydir; ls ..\\' always lists the root directory, not\nyour home directory, regardless of the option setting, because ls\ndoesn\\'t know about the links you followed, only zsh does, and it treats\nthe .. as referring to the root directory. Having CHASE_LINKS set\nallows `pwd\\' to warn you about where the system thinks you are.\nAn aside for non-UNIX-experts (over 99.9% of the population of the world\nat the last count): I said `symbolic links\\' instead of just `links\\'\nbecause there are others called `hard links\\'. This is what `ln\\'\ncreates if you don\\'t use the -s option. A hard link is not so much a\npointer to a file as an alternative name for a file. If you do\n  ln myfile othername\n  ls -l\nwhere myfile already exists you can\\'t tell which of myfile and\nothername is the original --- and in fact the system doesn\\'t care.\nYou can remove either, and the other will be perfectly happy as the name\nfor the file. This is pretty much how renaming files works, except that\ncreating the hard link is done for you in that case. Hard links have\nlimitations --- you can\\'t link to directories, or to a file on\nanother disk partition (and if you don\\'t know what a disk partition is,\nyou\\'ll see what a limitation that can be). Furthermore, you usually\nwant to know which is the original and which is the link --- so for\nmost users, creating symbolic links is more useful. The only drawback is\nthat following the pointers is a tiny bit slower; if you think you can\nnotice the difference, you definitely ought to slow down a bit.\nThe target of a symbolic link, unlike a hard link, doesn\\'t actually\nhave to exist and no checking is performed until you try to use the\nlink. The best thing to do is to run `ls -lL\\' when you create the\nlink; the -L part tells ls to follow links, and if it worked you\nshould see that your link is shown as having exactly the same\ncharacteristics as the file it points to. If it is still shown as a\nlink, there was no such file.\nWhile I\\'m at it, I should point out one slight oddity with symbolic\nlinks: the name of the file linked to (the first name), if it is not an\nabsolute path (beginning with / after any ~ expansion), is treated\nrelative to the directory where the link is created --- not the\ncurrent directory when you run ln. Here:\n  ln -s ../mydir ~/links/otherdir\nthe link otherdir will refer to mydir in its own parent directory,\ni.e. ~/links --- not, as you might think, the parent of the\ndirectory where you were when you ran the command. What makes it worse\nis that the second word, if is not an absolute path, is interpreted\nrelative to the directory where you ran the command.\n$cdpath and AUTO_CD\\\nWe\\'re nowhere near the end of the magic you can do with directories yet\n(and, in fact, I haven\\'t even got to the zsh-specific parts). The next\ntrick is $cdpath and $CDPATH. They look a lot like $path and\n$PATH which you met in the last chapter, and I mentioned them briefly\nback in the last chapter in that context: $cdpath is an array of\ndirectories, while $CDPATH is colon-separated list behaving otherwise\nlike a scalar variable. They give a list of directories whose\nsubdirectories you may want to change into. If you use a normal cd\ncommand (i.e. in the form `cddirname\\', and dirname does not\nbegin with a / or ~, the shell will look through the directories in\n$cdpath to find one which contains the subdirectory dirname. If\n$cdpath isn\\'t set, as you\\'d guess, it just uses the current\ndirectory.\nNote that $cdpath is always searched in order, and you can put a .\nin it to represent the current directory. If you do, the current\ndirectory will always be searched at that point, not necessarily\nfirst, which may not be what you expect. For example, let\\'s set up some\ndirectories:\n  mkdir ~/crick ~/crick/dna\n  mkdir ~/watson ~/watson/dna\n  cdpath=(~/crick .)\n  cd ~/watson\n  cd dna\nSo I\\'ve moved to the directory ~/watson, which contains the\nsubdirectory dna, and done `cd dna\\'. But because of $cdpath, the\nshell will look first in ~/crick, and find the dna there, and take\nyou to that copy of the self-reproducing directory, not the one in\n~/watson. Most people have . at the start of their cdpath for that\nreason. However, at least cd warns you --- if you tried it, you will\nsee that it prints the name of the directory it\\'s picked in cases like\nthis.\nIn fact, if you don\\'t have . in your directory at all, the shell will\nalways look there first; there\\'s no way of making cd never change to\na subdirectory of the current one, short of turning cd into a\nfunction. Some shells don\\'t do this; they use the directories in\n$cdpath, and only those.\nThere\\'s yet another shorthand, this time specific to zsh: the option\nAUTO_CD which I mentioned in the last chapter. That way a command\nwithout any arguments which is really a directory will take you to that\ndirectory. Normally that\\'s perfect --- you would just get a `command\nnot found\\' message otherwise, and you might as well make use of the\noption. Just occasionally, however, the name of a directory clashes with\nthe name of a command, builtin or external, or a shell function, and\nthen there can be some confusion: zsh will always pick the command as\nlong as it knows about it, but there are cases where it doesn\\'t, as I\ndescribed above.\nWhat I didn\\'t say in the last chapter is that AUTO_CD respects\n$cdpath; in fact, it really is implemented so that `dirname\\' on\nits own behaves as much like `cd dirname\\' as is possible without\ntying the shell\\'s insides into knots.\nThe directory stack\\\nOne very useful facility that zsh inherited from the C-shell family\n(traditional Korn shell doesn\\'t have it) is the directory stack. This\nis a list of directories you have recently been in. If you use the\ncommand `pushd\\' instead of `cd\\', e.g. `pushd dirname\\',\nthen the directory you are in is saved in this list, and you are taken\nto dirname, using $CDPATH just as cd does. Then when you type\n`popd\\', you are taken back to where you were. The list can be as\nlong as you like; you can pushd any number of directories, and each\npopd will take you back through the list (this is how a `stack\\', or\nmore precisely a `last-in-first-out\\' stack usually operates in\ncomputer jargon, hence the name `directory stack\\').\nYou can see the list --- which always starts with the current\ndirectory --- with the dirs command. So, for example:\n  cd ~\n  pushd ~/src\n  pushd ~/zsh\n  dirs\ndisplays\n  ~/zsh ~/src ~\nand the next popd will take you back to ~/src. If you do it, you\nwill see that pushd reports the list given by dirs automatically as\nit goes along; you can turn this off with the option PUSHD_SILENT,\nwhen you will have to rely on typing dirs explicitly.\nIn fact, a lot of the use of this comes not from using simple pushd\nand popd combinations, but from two other features. First, `pushd\\'\non its own swaps the top two directories on the stack. Second, pushd\nwith a numeric argument preceded by a `+\\' or `-\\' can take you to\none of the other directories in the list. The command `dirs -v\\'\ntells you the numbers you need; 0 is the current directory. So if you\nget,\n  0       ~/zsh\n  1       ~/src\n  2       ~\nthen `pushd +2\\' takes you to ~. (A little suspension of disbelief\nthat I didn\\'t just use AUTO_CD and type `..\\' is required here.)\nIf you use a -, it counts from the other end of the list; -0 (with\napologies to the numerate) is the last item, i.e. the same as ~ in\nthis case. Some people are used to having the `-\\' and `+\\'\narguments behave the other way around; the option PUSHD_MINUS exists\nfor this.\nApart from PUSHD_SILENT and PUSHD_MINUS, there are a few other\nrelevant options. Setting PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS means that if you pushd\nto a directory which is already somewhere in the list, the duplicate\nentry will be silently removed. This is useful for most human operations\n--- however, if you are using pushd in a function or script to\nremember previous directories for a future matching popd, this can be\ndangerous and you probably want to turn it off locally inside the\nfunction.\nAUTO_PUSHD means that any directory-changing command, including an\nauto-cd, is treated as a pushd command with the target directory as\nargument. Using this can make the directory stack get very long, and\nthere is a parameter $DIRSTACKSIZE which you can set to specify a\nmaximum length. The oldest entry (the highest number in the\n`dirs -v\\' listing) is automatically removed when this length is\nexceeded. There is no limit unless this is explicitly set.\nThe final pushd option is PUSHD_TO_HOME. This makes pushd on its\nown behave like cd on its own in that it takes you to your home\ndirectory, instead of swapping the top two directories. Normally a\nseries of `pushd\\' commands works pretty much like a series of\n`cd -\\' commands, always taking you the directory you were in before,\nwith the obvious difference that `cd -\\' doesn\\'t consult the\ndirectory stack, it just remembers the previous directory automatically,\nand hence it can confuse pushd if you just use `cd -\\' instead.\nThere\\'s one remaining subtlety with pushd, and that is what happens\nto the rest of the list when you bring a particular directory to the\nfront with something like `pushd +2\\'. Normally the list is simply\ncycled, so the directories which were +3, and +4 are now right behind\nthe new head of the list, while the two directories which were ahead of\nit get moved to the end. If the list before was:\n  dir1  dir2  dir3  dir4\nthen after pushd +2 you get\n  dir3  dir4  dir1 dir2\nThat behaviour changed during the lifetime of zsh, and some of us\npreferred the old behaviour, where that one directory was yanked to the\nfront and the rest just closed the gap:\n  # Old behaviour\n  dir3  dir1  dir2  dir4\nso that after a while you get a `greatest hits\\' group at the front of\nthe list. If you like this behaviour too (I feel as if I\\'d need to have\nwritten papers on group theory to like the new behaviour) there is a\nfunction pushd supplied with the source code, although it\\'s short\nenough to repeat here --- this is in the form for autoloading in the\nzsh fashion:\n  # pushd function to emulate the old zsh behaviour.\n  # With this, pushd +/-n lifts the selected element\n  # to the top of the stack instead of cycling\n  # the stack.\n\n  emulate -R zsh\n  setopt localoptions\n\n  if [[ ARGC -eq 1 && \"$1\" == [+-] ]] then\n          setopt pushdignoredups\n          builtin pushd ~$1\n  else\n          builtin pushd \"$@\"\n  fi\nThe `&&\\' is a logical `and\\', requiring both tests to be true. The\ntests are that there is exactly one argument to the function, and that\nit has the form of a `+\\' or a `-\\' followed by any number\n(`\\' is a special zsh pattern to match any number, an extension of\nforms like `\\' which matches any number in the range 1 to 100\ninclusive).\nReferring to other directories\\\nZsh has two ways of allowing you to refer to particular directories.\nThey have in common that they begin with a ~ (in very old versions of\nzsh, the second form actually used an `=\\', but the current way is\nmuch more logical).\nYou will certainly be aware, because I\\'ve made a lot of use of it, that\na `~\\' on its own or followed by a / refers to your own home\ndirectory. An extension of this --- again from the C-shell, although\nthe Korn shell has it too in this case --- is that ~name can refer\nto the home directory of any user on the system. So if your user name is\npws, then ~ and ~pws are the same directory.\nZsh has an extension to this; you can actually name your own\ndirectories. This was described in chapter 2, à\npropos of prompts, since that is the major use:\n  host% PS1='%~? '\n  ~? cd zsh/Src\n  ~/zsh/Src? zsrc=$PWD\n  ~/zsh/Src? echo ~zsrc\n  /home/pws/zsh/Src\n  ~zsrc?\nConsult that chapter for the ways of forcing a parameter to be\nrecognised as a named directory.\nThere\\'s a slightly more sophisticated way of doing this directly:\n  hash -d zsrc=~/zsh/Src\nmakes ~zsrc appear in prompts as before, and in this case there is no\nparameter $zsrc. This is the purist\\'s way (although very few zsh\nusers are purists). You can guess what `unhash -d zsrc\\' does; this\nworks with directories named via parameters, too, but leaves the\nparameter itself alone.\nIt\\'s possible to have a named directory with the same name as a user.\nIn that case `~name\\' refers to the directory you named explicitly,\nand there is no easy way of getting name\\'s home directory without\nremoving the name you defined.\nIf you\\'re using named directories with one of the cd-like commands or\nAUTO_CD, you can set the option CDABLEVARS which allows you to omit\nthe leading ~; `cd zsrc\\' with this option would take you to\n~zsrc. The name is a historical artifact and now a misnomer; it really\nis named directories, not parameters (i.e. variables), which are used.\nThe second way of referring to directories with ~\\'s is to use numbers\ninstead of names: the numbers refer to directories in the directory\nstack. So if dirs -v gives you\n  0       ~zsf\n  1       ~src\nthen ~+1 and ~-0 (not very mathematical, but quite logical if you\nthink about it) refer to ~src. In this case, unlike pushd arguments,\nyou can omit the + and use ~1. The option PUSHD_MINUS is\nrespected. You\\'ll see this was used in the pushd function above: the\ntrick was that ~+3, for example, refers to the same element as\npushd +3, hence pushd ~+3 pushed that directory onto the front of\nthe list. However, we set PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS, so that the value in the\nold position was removed as well, giving us the effect we wanted of\nsimply yanking the directory to the front with no trick cycling.\n[]{#l36}\n3.2.5: Command control and information commands\nVarious builtins exist which control how you access commands, and which\nshow you information about the commands which can be run.\nThe first two are strictly speaking `precommand modifiers\\' rather than\ncommands: that means that they go before a command line and modify its\nbehaviour, rather than being commands in their own right. If you put\n`command\\' in front of a command line, the command word (the next one\nalong) will be taken as the name of an external command, however it\nwould normally be interpreted; likewise, if you put `builtin\\' in\nfront, the shell will try to run the command as a builtin command.\nNormally, shell functions take precedence over builtins which take\nprecedence over external commands. So, for example, if your printer\ncontrol system has the command `enable\\' (as many System V versions\ndo), which clashes with a builtin I am about to talk about, you can run\n`command enable lp\\' to enable a printer; otherwise, the builtin\nenable would have been run. Likewise, if you have defined cd to be a\nfunction, but this time want to call the normal builtin cd, you can\nsay `builtin cd mydir\\'.\nA common use for command is inside a shell function of the same name.\nSometimes you want to enhance an ordinary command by sticking some extra\nstuff around it, then calling that command, so you write a shell\nfunction of the same name. To call the command itself inside the shell\nfunction, you use `command\\'. The following works, although it\\'s\nobviously not all that useful as it stands:\n  ls() {\n    command ls \"$[@]\"\n  }\nso when you run `ls\\', it calls the function, which calls the real\nls command, passing on the arguments you gave it.\nYou can gain longer lasting control over the commands which the shell\nwill run with the `disable\\' and `enable\\' commands. The first\nnormally takes builtin arguments; each such builtin will not be\nrecognised by the shell until you give an `enable\\' command for it.\nSo if you want to be able to run the external enable command and\ndon\\'t particularly care about the builtin version, `disable enable\\'\n(sorry if that\\'s confusing) will do the trick. Ha, you\\'re thinking,\nyou can\\'t run `enable enable\\'. That\\'s correct: some time in the\ndim and distant past, builtin enable enable\\' would have worked, but\ncurrently it doesn\\'t; this may change, if I remember to change it. You\ncan list all disabled builtins with just `disable\\' on its own ---\nmost of the builtins that do this sort of manipulation work like that.\nYou can manipulate other sets of commands with disable and enable by\ngiving different options: aliases with the option -a, functions with\n-f, and reserved words with -r. The first two you probably know\nabout, and I\\'ll come to them anyway, but `reserved words\\' need\ndescribing. They are essentially builtin commands which have some\nspecial syntactic meaning to the shell, including some symbols such as\n`{\\' and `[[\\'. They take precedence over everything else except\naliases --- in fact, since they\\'re syntactically special, the shell\nneeds to know very early on that it has found a reserved word, it\\'s no\nuse just waiting until it tries to execute a command. For example, if\nthe shell finds `[[\\' it needs to know that everything until `]]\\'\nmust be treated as a test rather than as ordinary command arguments.\nConsequently, you wouldn\\'t often want to disable a reserved word, since\nthe shell wouldn\\'t work properly. The most obvious reason why you might\nwould be for compatibility with some other shell which didn\\'t have one.\nYou can get a complete list with:\n  whence -wm '*' | grep reserved\nwhich I\\'ll explain below, since I\\'m coming to `whence\\'.\nFurthermore, I tend to find that if I want to get rid of aliases or\nfunctions I use the commands `unalias\\' and `unfunction\\' to get\nrid of them permanently, since I always have the original definitions\nstored somewhere, so these two options may not be that useful either.\nDisabling builtins is definitely the most useful of the four\npossibilities for disable.\nExternal commands have to be manipulated differently. The types given\nabove are handled internally by the shell, so all it needs to do is\nremember what code to call. With external commands, the issue instead is\nhow to find them. I mentioned rehash above, but didn\\'t tell you that\nthe hash command, which you\\'ve already seen with the -d option, can\nbe used to tell the shell how to find an external command:\n  hash foo=/path/to/foo\nmakes foo execute the command using the path shown (which doesn\\'t\neven have to end in `foo\\'). This is rather like an alias --- most\npeople would probably do this with an alias, in fact --- although a\nlittle faster, though you\\'re unlikely to notice the difference. You can\nremove this with unhash. One gotcha here is that if the path is\nrehashed, either by calling rehash or when you alter $path, the\nentire hash table is emptied, including anything you put in in this way;\nso it\\'s not particularly useful.\nIn the midst of all this, it\\'s useful to be able to find out what the\nshell thinks a particular command name does. The command `whence\\'\ntells you this; it also exists, with slightly different options, under\nthe names where, which and type, largely to provide compatibility\nwith other shells. I\\'ll just stick to whence.\nIts standard output isn\\'t actually sparklingly interesting. If it\\'s a\ncommand somehow known to the shell internally, it gets echoed back, with\nthe alias expanded if it was an alias; if it\\'s an external command\nit\\'s printed with the full path, showing where it came from; and if\nit\\'s not known the command returns status 1 and prints nothing.\nYou can make it more useful with the -v or -c options, which are\nmore verbose; the first prints out an information message, while the\nsecond prints out the definitions of any functions it was asked about\n(this is also the effect of using `which\\' instead of `whence). A\nvery useful option is -m, which takes any arguments as patterns using\nthe usual zsh pattern format, in other words the same one used for\nmatching files. Thus\n  whence -vm \"*\"\nprints out every command the shell knows about, together with what it\nthinks of it.\nNote the quotes around the `*\\' --- you have to remember these\nanywhere where the pattern is not to be used to generate filenames on\nthe command line, but instead needs to be passed to the command to be\ninterpreted. If this seems a rather subtle distinction, think about what\nwould happen if you ran\n  # Oops.  Better not try this at home.\n  # (Even better, don't do it at work either.)\n  whence -vm *\nin a directory with the files `foo\\' and (guess what) `bar\\' in\nit. The shell hasn\\'t decided what command it\\'s going to run when it\nfirst looks at the command line; it just sees the `*\\' and expands\nthe line to\n  whence -vm foo bar\nwhich isn\\'t what you meant.\nThere are a couple of other tricks worth mentioning: -p makes the\nshell search your path for them, even if the name is matched as\nsomething else (say, a shell function). So if you have ls defined as a\nfunction,\n  which -p ls\nwill still tell what `command ls\\' would find. Also, the option -a\nsearches for all commands; in the same example, this would show you both\nthe ls command and the ls function, whereas whence would normally\nonly show the function because that\\'s the one that would be run. The\n-a option also shows if it finds more than one external command in\nyour path.\nFinally, the option -w is useful because it identifies the type of a\ncommand with a single word: alias, builtin, command, function,\nhashed, reserved or none. Most of those are obvious, with\ncommand being an ordinary external command; hashed is an external\ncommand which has been explicitly given a path with the hash builtin,\nand none means it wasn\\'t recognised as a command at all. Now you know\nhow we extracted the reserved words above.\nA close relative of whence is functions, which applies, of course,\nto shell functions; it usually lists the definitions of all functions\ngiven as arguments, but its relatives (of which autoload is one)\nperform various other tricks, to be described in the section on shell\nfunctions below. Be careful with function, without the `s\\', which is\ncompletely different and not like command or builtin --- it is\nactually a keyword used to define a function.\n[]{#l37}\n3.2.6: Parameter control\nThere are various builtins for controlling the shells parameters. You\nalready know how to set and use parameters, but it\\'s a good deal more\ncomplicated than that when you look at the details.\nLocal parameters\\\nThe principal command for manipulating the behaviour of parameters is\n`typeset\\'. Its easiest usage is to declare a parameter; you just\ngive it a list of parameter names, which are created as scalar\nparameters. You can create parameters just by assigning to them, but the\nmajor point of `typeset\\' is that if a parameter is created that way\ninside a function, the parameter is restored to its original value, or\nremoved if it didn\\'t previously exist, at the end of the function ---\nin other words, it has `local scope\\' like the variables which you\ndeclare in most ordinary programming languages. In fact, to use the\njargon it has `dynamical\\' rather than `syntactic\\' scope, which means\nthat the same parameter is visible in any function called within the\ncurrent one; this is different from, say, C or FORTRAN where any\nfunction or subroutine called wouldn\\'t see any variable declared in the\nparent function.\nThe following makes this more concrete.\n  var='Original value'\n  subfn() {\n    print $var\n  }\n  fn() {\n    print $var\n    typeset var='Value in function'\n    print $var\n    subfn\n  }\n  fn\n  print $var\nThis chunk of code prints out\n  Original value\n  Value in function\n  Value in function\n  Original value\nThe first three chunks of the code just define the parameter $var, and\ntwo functions, subfn and fn. Then we call fn. The first thing this\ndoes is print out $var, which gives `Original value\\' since we\nhaven\\'t changed the original definition. However, the typeset next\ndoes that; as you see, we can assign to the parameter during the\ntypeset. Thus when we print $var out again, we get\n`Value in function\\'. Then subfn is called, which prints out the\nsame value as in fn, because we haven\\'t changed it --- this is\nwhere C or FORTRAN would differ, and wouldn\\'t recognise the variable\nbecause it hadn\\'t been declared in that function. Finally, fn exits\nand the original value is restored, and is printed out by the final\n`print\\'.\nNote the value changes twice: first at the typeset, then again at the\nend of fn. The value of $var at any point will be one of those two\nvalues.\nAlthough you can do assignments in a typeset statement, you can\\'t\nassign to arrays (I already said this in the last chapter):\n  typeset var=(Doesn\\'t work\\!)\nbecause the syntax with the parentheses is special; it only works when\nthe line consists of nothing but assignments. However, the shell\ndoesn\\'t complain if you try to assign an array to a scalar, or vice\nversa; it just silently converts the type:\n  typeset var='scalar value'\n  var=(array value)\nI put in the assignment in the typeset statement to rub the point in\nthat it creates scalars, but actually the usual way of setting up an\narray in a function is\n  typeset var\n  var=()\nwhich creates an empty scalar, then converts that to an empty array.\nRecent versions of the shell have `typeset -a var\\' to do that in one\ngo --- but you still can\\'t assign to it in the same statement.\nThere are other catches associated with the fact that typeset and its\nrelatives are just ordinary commands with ordinary sets of arguments.\nConsider this:\n  % typeset var=`echo two words`\n  % print $var\n  two\nWhat has happened to the `words\\'? The answer is that backquote\nsubstitution, to be discussed below, splits words when not quoted. So\nthe typeset statement is equivalent to\n  % typeset var=two words\nThere are two ways to get round this; first, use an ordinary assignment:\n  % typeset var\n  % var=`echo two words`\nwhich can tell a scalar assignment, and hence knows not to split words,\nor quote the backquotes,\n  % typeset var=\"`echo two words`\"\nThere are three important types we haven\\'t talked about; both of these\ncan only be created with typeset or one of the similar builtins I\\'ll\nlist in a moment. They are integer types, floating point types, and\nassociative array types.\nNumeric parameters\\\nIntegers are created with `typeset -i\\', or `integer\\' which is\nanother way of saying the same thing. They are used for arithmetic,\nwhich the shell can do as follows:\n  integer i\n  (( i = 3 * 2 + 1 ))\nThe double parentheses surround a complete arithmetic expression: it\nbehaves as if it\\'s quoted. The expression inside can be pretty much\nanything you might be used to from arithmetic in other programming\nlanguages. One important point to note is that parameters don\\'t need to\nhave the $ in front, even when their value is being taken:\n  integer i j=12\n  (( i = 3 * ( j + 4 ) ** 2 ))\nHere, j will be replaced by 12 and $i gets the value 768 (sixteen\nsquared times three). One thing you might not recognise is the **,\nwhich is the `to the power of\\' operator which occurs in FORTRAN and\nPerl. Note that it\\'s fine to have parentheses inside the double\nparentheses --- indeed, you can even do\n  (( i = (3 * ( j + 4 )) ** 2 ))\nand the shell won\\'t get confused because it knows that any parentheses\ninside must be in balanced pairs (until you deliberately confuse it with\nyour buggy code).\nYou would normally use `print $i\\' to see what value had been given\nto $i, of course, and as you would expect it gets printed out as a\ndecimal number. However, typeset allows you to specify another base\nfor printing out. If you do\n  typeset -i 16 i\n  print $i\nafter the last calculation, you should see 16#900, which means 900 in\nbase 16 (hexadecimal). That\\'s the only effect the option `-i 16\\'\nhas on $i --- you can assign to it and use it in arithmetical\nexpressions just as normal, but when you print it out it appears in this\nform. You can use this base notation for inputting numbers, too:\n  (( i = 16#ff * 2#10 ))\nwhich means 255 (ff in hexadecimal) times 2 (10 in binary). The\nshell understands C notation too, so `16#ff\\' could have been\nexpressed `0xff\\'.\nFloating point variables are very similar. You can declare them with\n`typeset -F\\' or `typeset -E\\'. The only difference between the\ntwo is, again, on output; -F uses a fixed point notation, while -E\nuses scientific (mnemonic: exponential) notation. The builtin\n`float\\' is equivalent to `typeset -E\\' (because Korn shell does\nit, that\\'s why). Floating point expressions also work the way you are\nprobably used to:\n  typeset -E e\n  typeset -F f\n  (( e = 32/3, f = 32.0/3.0 ))\n  print $e $f\nprints\n  1.000000000e+01 10.6666666667\nVarious points: the `,\\' can separate different expressions, just\nlike in C, so the e and f assignments are performed separately. The\ne assignment was actually an integer division, because neither 32 nor\n3 is a floating point number, which must contain a dot. That means an\ninteger division was done, producing 10, which was then converted to a\nfloating point number only at the end. Again, this is just how grown-up\nlanguages work, so it\\'s no use cursing. The f assignment was a full\nfloating point performance. Floating point parameters weren\\'t available\nbefore version 3.1.7.\nAlthough this is really a matter for a later chapter, there is a library\nof floating point functions you can load (actually it\\'s just a way of\nlinking in the system mathematical library). The usual incantation is\n`zmodload zsh/mathfunc\\'; you may not have `dynamic loading\\' of\nlibraries on your system, which may mean that doesn\\'t work. If it does,\nyou can do things like\n  (( pi = 4.0 * atan(1.0) ))\nBroadly, all the functions which appear in most system mathematical\nlibraries (see the manual page for math) are available in zsh.\nLike all other parameters created with typeset or one of its cousins,\ninteger and floating point parameters are local to functions. You may\nwonder how to create a global parameter (i.e. one which is valid outside\nas well as inside the function) which has an integer or floating point\nvalue. There\\'s a recent addition to the shell (in version 3.1.6) which\nallows this: use the flag -g to typeset along with any others. For\nexample,\n  fn() {\n    typeset -Fg f\n    (( f = 42.75 ))\n  }\n  fn\n  print $f\nIf you try it, you will see the value of $f has survived beyond the\nfunction. The g stands for global, obviously, although it\\'s not quite\nthat simple:\n  fn() {\n    typeset -Fg f\n  }\n  outerfn() {\n    typeset f='scalar value'\n    fn\n    print $f\n  }\n  outerfn\nThe function outerfn creates a local scalar value for f; that\\'s\nwhat fn sees. So it was not really operating on a `global\\' value, it\njust didn\\'t create a new one for the scope of fn. The error message\ncomes because it tried to preserve the value of $f while changing its\ntype, and the value wasn\\'t a proper floating point expression. The\nerror message,\n  fn: bad math expression: operator expected at `value'\ncomes about because assigning to numeric parameters always does an\narithmetic evaluation. Operating on `scalar value\\' it found\n`scalar\\' and assumed this was a parameter, then looked for an\noperator like `+\\' to come next; instead it found `value\\'. If you\nwant to experiment, change the string to `scalar + value\\' and set\n`value=42\\', or whatever, then try again. This is a little confusing\n(which is a roundabout way of saying it confused me), but consistent\nwith how zsh usually treats parameters.\nActually, to a certain extent you don\\'t need to use the integer and\nfloating point parameters. Any time zsh needs a numeric expression it\nwill force a scalar to the right value, and any time it produces a\nnumeric expression and assigns it to a scalar, it will convert the\nresult to a string. So\n  typeset num=3            # This is the *string* `3'.\n  (( num = num + 1 ))      # But this works anyway\n                           # ($num is still a string).\nThis can be useful if you have a parameter which is sometimes a number,\nsometimes a string, since zsh does all the conversion work for you.\nHowever, it can also be confusing if you always want a number, because\nzsh can\\'t guess that for you; plus it\\'s a little more efficient not to\nhave to convert back and forth; plus you lose accuracy when you do,\nbecause if the number is stored as a string rather than in the internal\nnumeric representation, what you say is what you get (although zsh tends\nto give you quite a lot of decimal places when converting implicitly to\nstrings). Anyway, I\\'d recommend that if you know a parameter has to be\nan integer or floating point value you should declare it as such.\nThere is a builtin called let to handle mathematical expressions, but\nsince\n  let \"num = num + 1\"\nis equivalent to\n  (( num = num + 1 ))\nand the second form is easier and more memorable, you probably won\\'t\nneed to use it. If you do, remember that (unlike BASIC) each\nmathematical expression should appear as one argument in quotes.\nAssociative arrays\\\nThe one remaining major type of parameter is the associative array; if\nyou use Perl, you may call it a `hash\\', but we tend not to since\nthat\\'s really a description of how it\\'s implemented rather than what\nit does. (All right, what it does is hash things. Now shut up.)\nThese have to be declared by a typeset statement --- there\\'s no\ngetting round it. There are some quite eclectic builtins that produce a\nfilled-in associative array for you, but the only way to tell zsh you\nwant your very own associative array is\n  typeset -A assoc\nto create $assoc. As to what it does, that\\'s best shown by example:\n  typeset -A assoc\n  assoc=(one eins two zwei three drei)\n  print ${assoc[two]}\nwhich prints `zwei\\'. So it works a bit like an ordinary array, but\nthe numeric subscript of an ordinary array which would have appeared\ninside the square bracket is replaced by the string key, in this case\ntwo. The array assignment was a bit deceptive; the `values\\' were\nactually pairs, with `one\\' being the key for the value `eins\\',\nand so on. The shell will complain if there are an odd number of\nelements in such a list. This may also be familiar from Perl. You can\nassign values one at a time:\n  assoc[four]=vier\nand also unset one key/value pair:\n  unset 'assoc[one]'\nwhere the quotes stop the square brackets from being interpreted as a\npattern on the command line.\nExpansion has been held over, but you might like to know about the ways\nof getting back what you put in. If you do\n  print $assoc\nyou just see the values --- that\\'s exactly the same as with an\nordinary array, where the subscripts 1, 2, 3, etc. aren\\'t shown. Note\nthey are in random order --- that\\'s the other main difference from\nordinary arrays; associative arrays have no notion of an order unless\nyou explicitly sort them.\nBut here the keys may be just as interesting. So there is:\n  print ${(k)assoc}\n  print ${(kv)assoc}\ngiving (if you\\'ve followed through all the commands above):\n  four two three\n  four vier two zwei three drei\nwhich print out the keys instead of the values, and the key and value\npairs much as you entered them. You can see that, although the order of\nthe pairs isn\\'t obvious, it\\'s the same each time. From this example\nyou can work out how to copy an associative array into another one:\n  typeset -A newass\n  newass=(${(kv)assoc})\nwhere the `(kv)\\' is important --- as is the typeset just before\nthe assignment, otherwise $newass would be a badass ordinary array.\nYou can also prove that ${(v)assoc} does what you would probably\nexpect. There are lots of other tricks, but they are mostly associated\nwith clever types of parameter expansion, to be described in chapter\n5.\nOther typeset and type tricks\\\nThere are variants of typeset, some mentioned sporadically above.\nThere is nothing you can do with any of them that you can\\'t do with\ntypeset --- that wasn\\'t always the case; we\\'ve tried to improve\nthe orthogonality of the options. They differ in the options which are\nset by default, and the additional options which are allowed. Here\\'s a\nlist: declare, export, float, integer, local, readonly. I\nwon\\'t confuse you by describing all in detail; see the manual.\nIf there is an odd one out, it\\'s export, which not only marks a\nparameter for export but has the -g flag turned on by default, so that\nthat parameter is not local to the function; in other words, it\\'s\nequivalent to typeset -gx. However, one holdover from the days when\nthe options weren\\'t quite so logical is that typeset -x behaves like\nexport, in other words the -g flag is turned on by default. You can\nfix this by unsetting the option GLOBAL_EXPORT --- the option only\nexists for compatibility; logically it should always be unset. This is\npartly because in the old days you couldn\\'t export local parameters, so\ntypeset -x either had to turn on -g or turn off -x; that was fixed\nfor the 3.1.9 release, and (for example) `local -x\\' creates a local\nparameter which is exported to the environment; both the parameter\nitself, and the value in the environment, will be restored when the\nfunction exits. The builtin local is essentially a form of typeset\nwhich renounces the -g flag and all its works.\nAnother old restriction which has gone is that you couldn\\'t make\nspecial parameters, in particular $PATH, local to a function; you just\nmodified the original parameter. Now if you say `typeset PATH\\',\nthings happen the way you probably expect, with $PATH having its usual\neffect, and being restored to its old value when the function exits.\nSince $PATH is still special, though, you should make sure you assign\nsomething to it in the function before calling external commands, else\nit will be empty and no commands will be found. It\\'s possible that you\nspecifically don\\'t want some parameter you make local to have the\nspecial property; 3.1.7 and after allow the typeset flag -h to hide\nthe specialness for that parameter, so in `typeset -h PATH\\', PATH\nwould be an ordinary variable for the duration of the enclosing\nfunction. Internally, the same value as was previously set would\ncontinue to be used for finding commands, but it wouldn\\'t be exported.\nThe second main use of typeset is to set attributes for the\nparameters. In this case it can operate on an existing parameter, as\nwell as creating a new one. For example,\n  typeset -r msg='This is an important message.'\nsets the readonly flag (-r) for the parameter msg. If the parameter\ndidn\\'t exist, it would be created with the usual scoping rules; but if\nit did exist at the current level of scoping, it would be made readonly\nwith the value assigned to it, meaning you can\\'t set that particular\ncopy of the parameter. For obvious reasons, it\\'s normal to assign a\nvalue to a readonly parameter when you first declare it. Here\\'s a\nreality check on how this affects scoping:\n   msg='This is an ordinary parameter'\n   fn() {\n     typeset msg='This is a local ordinary parameter'\n     print $msg\n     typeset -r msg='This is a local readonly parameter'\n     print $msg\n     msg='Watch me cause an error.'\n   }\n   fn\n   print $msg\n   msg='This version of the parameter'\\ \n   ' can still be overwritten'\n   print $msg\noutputs\n  This is a local ordinary parameter\n  This is a local readonly parameter\n  fn:5: read-only variable: msg\n  This is an ordinary parameter\n  This version of the parameter can still be overwritten\nUnfortunately there was a bug with this code until recently --- thirty\nseconds ago, actually: the second typeset in fn incorrectly added\nthe readonly flag to the existing msg before attempting to set the\nnew value, which was wrong and inconsistent with what happens if you\ncreate a new local parameter. Maybe it\\'s reassuring that the shell can\nget confused about local parameters, too. (I don\\'t find it reassuring\nin the slightest, since typeset is one of the parts of the code where\nI tend to fix the bugs, but maybe you do.)\nAnyway, when the bug is fixed, you should get the output shown, because\nthe first typeset created a local variable which the second typeset made\nreadonly, so that the final assignment caused an error. Then the $msg\nin the function went out of scope, and the ordinary parameter, with no\nreadonly restriction, was visible again.\nI mentioned another special typeset option in the previous chapter:\n  typeset -T TEXINPUTS texinputs\nto tie together the scalar $TEXINPUTS and the array $texinputs in\nthe same way that $PATH and $path work. This is a one-off; it\\'s the\nonly time typeset takes exactly two parameter names on the command\nline. All other uses of typeset take a list of parameters to which any\nflags given are applied. See the manual for the remaining flags,\nalthough most of the more interesting ones have been discussed.\nThe other thing you need to know about flags is that you use them with a\n`+\\' sign to turn off the corresponding attribute. So\n  typeset +r msg\nallows you to set $msg again. From version 4.1, you won\\'t be able\nto turn off the readonly attribute for a special parameter; that\\'s\nbecause there\\'s too much scope for confusion, including attempting to\nset constant strings in the code. For example, `$ZSH_VERSION\\' always\nprints a fixed string; attempting to change that is futile.\nThe final use of typeset is to list parameters. If you type\n`typeset\\' on its own, you get a complete list of parameters and\ntheir values. From 3.1.7, you can turn on the flag -H for a parameter,\nwhich means to hide its value while you\\'re doing this. This can be\nuseful for some of the more enormous parameters, particularly special\nparameters which I\\'ll talk about in the section in chapter\n7 on modules, which tend to swamp the display\ntypeset produces.\nYou can also list parameters of a particular type, by listing the flags\nyou want to know about. For example,\n  typeset -r\nlists all readonly parameters. You might expect `typeset +r\\' to list\nparameters which don\\'t have that attribute, but actually it lists the\nsame parameters but without showing their value. `typeset +\\' lists\nall parameters in this way.\nAnother good way of finding out about parameters is to use the special\nexpansion `${(t)param}\\', for example\n  print ${(t)PATH}\nprints `scalar-export-special\\': $PATH is a scalar parameter, with\nthe -x flag set, and has a special meaning to the shell. Actually,\n`special\\' means something a bit more than that: it means the\ninternal code to get and set the parameter behaves in a way which has\nside effects, either to the parameter itself or elsewhere in the shell.\nThere are other parameters, like $HISTFILE, which are used by the\nshell, but which are get and set in a normal way --- they are only\nspecial in that the value is looked at by the shell; and, after all, any\nold shell function can do that, too. Contrast this with $PATH which\nhas all that paraphernalia to do with hashing commands to take care of\nwhen it\\'s set, as I discussed above, and I hope you\\'ll see the\ndifference.\nReading into parameters\\\nThe `read\\' builtin, as its name suggests, is the opposite to\n`print\\' (there\\'s no `write\\' command in the shell, though there\nis often an external command of that name to send a message to another\nuser), but reading, unlike printing, requires something in the shell to\nchange to take the value, so unlike print, read is forced to be a\nbuiltin. Inevitably, the values are read into a parameter. Normally they\nare taken from standard input, very often the terminal (even if you\\'re\nrunning a script, unless you redirected the input). So the simplest case\nis just\n  read param\nand if you type a line, and hit return, it will be put into $param,\nwithout the final newline.\nThe read builtin actually does a bit of processing on the input. It\nwill usually strip any initial or final whitespace (spaces or tabs) from\nthe line read in, though any in the middle are kept. You can read a set\nof values separated by whitespace just by listing the parameters to\nassign them to; the last parameter gets all the remainder of the line\nwithout it being split. Very often it\\'s easiest just to read into an\narray:\n  % read -A array\n        this is a line typed in now, \\ \n      by me,    in this   space\n  % print ${array[1]} ${array[12]}\n  this space\n(I\\'m assuming you\\'re using the native zsh array format, rather than\nthe one set with KSH_ARRAYS, and shall continue to assume this.)\nIt\\'s useful to be able to print a prompt when you want to read\nsomething. You can do this with `print -n\\', but there\\'s a\nshorthand:\n  % read line'?Please enter a line: '\n  Please enter a line: some words\n  % print $line\n  some words\nNote the quotes surround the `?\\' to prevent it being taken as part\nof a pattern on the command line. You can quote the whole expression\nfrom the beginning of `line\\', if you like; I just write it like that\nbecause I know parameter names don\\'t need quoting, because they can\\'t\nhave funny characters in. It\\'s almost logical.\nAnother useful trick with read is to read a single character; the\n`-k\\' option does this, and in fact you can stick a number\nimmediately after the `k\\' which specifies a number to read. Even\neasier, the `-q\\' option reads a single character and returns status\n0 if it was y or Y, and status 1 otherwise; thus you can read the\nanswer to yes/no questions without using a parameter at all. Note,\nhowever, that if you don\\'t supply a parameter, the reply gets assigned\nin any case to $REPLY if it\\'s a scalar --- as it is with -q ---\nor $reply if it\\'s an array --- i.e. if you specify -A, but no\nparameter name. These are more examples of the non-special parameters\nwhich the shell uses --- it sets $REPLY or $reply, but only in the\nsame way you would set them; there are no side-effects.\nLike print, read has a -r flag for raw mode. However, this just\nhas one effect for read: without it, a \\ at the end of the line\nspecifies that the next line is a continuation of the current one (you\ncan do this when you\\'re typing at the terminal). With it, \\ is not\ntreated specially.\nFinally, a more sophisticated note about word-splitting. I said that,\nwhen you are reading to many parameters or an array, the word is split\non whitespace. In fact the shell splits words on any of the characters\nfound in the (genuinely special, because it affects the shell\\'s guts)\nparameter $IFS, which stands for `input field separator\\'. By default\n--- and in the vast majority of uses --- it contains space, tab,\nnewline and a null character (character zero: if you know that these are\nusually used to mark the end of strings, you might be surprised the\nshell handles these as ordinary characters, but it does, although\nprinting them out usually doesn\\'t show anything). However, you can set\nit to any string: enter\n  fn() {\n    local IFS=:\n    read -A array\n    print -l $array\n  }\n  fn\nand type\none word:two words:three words:four\nThe shell will show you what\\'s in the array it\\'s read, one `word\\'\nper line:\n  one word\n  two words\n  three words\n  four\nYou\\'ll see the bananas, er, words (joke for the over-thirties) have\nbeen treated as separated by a colon, not by whitespace. Making $IFS\nlocal didn\\'t work in old versions of zsh, as with other specials; you\nhad to save it and restore it.\nThe read command in zsh doesn\\'t let you do line editing, which some\nshells do. For that, you should use the vared command, which runs the\nline editor to edit a parameter, with the -c option, which allows\nvared to create a new parameter. It also takes the option -p to\nspecify a prompt, so one of the examples above can be rewritten\n  vared -c -p 'Please enter a line: ' line\nwhich works rather like read but with full editing support. If you give\nthe option -h (history), you can even retrieve values from previous\ncommand lines. It doesn\\'t have all the formatting options of read,\nhowever, although when reading an array (use the option -a with -c\nif creating a new array) it will perform splitting.\nOther builtins to control parameters\\\nThe remaining builtins which handle parameters can be dealt with more\nswiftly.\nThe builtin set simply sets the special parameter which is passed as\nan argument to functions or scripts, and which you access as $* or\n$@, or $ (Bourne-like format), or via $argv (csh-like\nformat), known however you set them as the `positional parameters\\':\n  % set a whole load of words\n  % print $1\n  a\n  % print $*\n  a whole load of words\n  % print $argv[2,-2]\n  whole load of\nIt\\'s exactly as if you were in a function and had called the function\nwith the arguments `a whole load of words\\'. Actually, set can also\nbe used to set shell options, either as flags, e.g. `set -x\\', or as\nwords after `-o\\' , e.g. `set -o xtrace\\' does the same as the\nprevious example. It\\'s generally easier to use setopt, and the upshot\nis that you need to be careful when setting arguments this way in case\nthey begin with a `-\\'. Putting `-``-\\' before the real arguments\nfixes this.\nOne other use of set is to set any array, via\n  set -A any_array words to assign to any_array\nwhich is equivalent to (and the standard Korn shell version of)\n  any_array=(words to assign to any_array)\nOne case where the set version is more useful is if the name of an\narray itself comes from a parameter:\n  arrname=myarray\n  set -A $arrname words to assign\nhas no easy equivalent in the other form; the left hand side of an\nordinary assignment won\\'t expand a parameter:\n  # Doesn't work; syntax error\n  $arrname=(words to assign)\nThis worked in old versions of zsh, but that was on the non-standard\nside. The eval command, described below, gives another way around\nthis.\nNext comes `shift\\', which simply moves an array up one element,\ndeleting the original first one. Without an array name, it operates on\nthe positional parameters. You can also give it a number to shift other\nthan one, before the array name.\n  shift array\nis equivalent to\n  array=(${array[2,-1]})\n(almost --- I\\'ll leave the subtleties here for the chapter on\nexpansion) which picks the second to last elements of the array and\nassigns them back to the original array. Note, yet again, that shift\noperates using the name, not the value of the array, so no `$\\'\nshould appear in front, otherwise you get something similar to the trick\nI showed for `set -A\\'.\nFinally, unset unsets a parameter, and I already showed you could\nunset a key/value pair of an associative array. There is one subtlety to\nbe mentioned here. Normally, unset just makes the parameter named\ndisappear off the face of the earth. However, if you call unset in a\nfunction, its ghost lives on in the sense that any parameter you create\nin the same name will be scoped as the original parameter was. Hence:\n  var='global value'\n  fn() {\n    typeset var='local value'\n    unset var\n    var='what about this?'\n  }\n  fn\n  print $var\nThe final statement prints `global value\\': even though the local\ncopy of $var was unset, the shell remembers that it was local, so the\nsecond $var in the function is also local and its value disappears at\nthe end of the function.\n[]{#l38}\n3.2.7: History control commands\nThe easiest way to access the shell\\'s command history is by editing it\ndirectly. The second easiest way is to use the `!\\'-history\nmechanism. Other ways of manipulating it are based around the fc\nbuiltin, which probably once stood for something (according to Oliver\nKiddle, `fix command\\', which is as good as anything). I talked quite a\nbit about it in the last chapter, and don\\'t really have anything to\nadd. Just note that the two other commands based around it are history\nand r.\n[]{#l39}\n3.2.8: Job control and process control\nOne of the major contributions of the C-shell was job control. You need\nto know about foreground and background tasks, and again I introduced\nthese in the last chapter along with the options that control them. Here\nis an introduction to the relevant builtins.\nYou start a background job in two ways. First, directly, by putting an\n`&\\' after it:\n  sleep 10 &\nand secondly by starting it in the normal way (i.e. in the foreground),\nthen typing ^Z, and using the bg command to put it in the\nbackground. Between typing ^Z and bg, the job is still there, but is\nnot running; it is `suspended\\' or `stopped\\' (systems use different\ndescriptions for the same thing), waiting for you to decide what to do\nwith it. In either case, the job then continues without the shell\nwaiting for it. It will still try and read from or write to the terminal\nif that\\'s how you started it; you need to use the shell\\'s redirection\nfacilities right at the start if you want to change that, there\\'s\nnothing you can do after the job has already started.\nBy the way, `sleep\\' isn\\'t a builtin. Oddly enough, you can suspend a\nbuiltin command or sequence of commands (such as shell function) with\n^Z, although since the shell has to continue executing your commands\nas well as being suspended, it does the only thing it can do --- fork,\nso that the commands you suspend are put into the background. Probably\nyou will only rarely do this with builtins. No other shell, so far as I\nknow, has this feature.\nA job will stop if it needs to read from the terminal. You see a message\nlike:\n  [1]  + 1348 suspended (tty input)  jobname and arguments\nwhich means the job is suspended very much like you had just typed ^Z.\nYou need to bring the job into the forground, as described below, so\nthat you can type something to it.\nBy the way, the key to type to suspend a command may not be ^Z; it\nusually is, but that can be changed. Run `stty -a\\' and look for what\nis listed after `susp =\\' --- probably, but not necessarily, ^Z.\nSo if you want to use another character --- it must be a single\ncharacter; this is handled deep in the terminal interface, not in the\nshell --- you can run\n  stty susp '^]'\nor whatever. You will note from the stty output that various other job\ncontrol characters can be changed similarly. The stty command is\nexternal and its format for both output and input can vary quite a bit\nfrom system to system.\nInstead of putting the command into the background, you can bring it\nback to the foreground again with fg. This is useful for temporarily\nstopping what you are doing so you can do something else. These days you\nwould probably do it in another window; in the old days when people\nlogged in from simple terminals this was even more useful. A typical\nexample of this is\n  more file                        # look at file\n  ^Z                               # suspend\n  [1] + 8592 suspended  more file  # message printed\n  ...                              # do something else\n  fg %1                            # resume the `more'\nThe `%\\' is the usual way of referring to jobs. The number after it\nis what appeared in square brackets with the suspended message; I don\\'t\nknow why the shell doesn\\'t use the `%\\' notation there, too. You\nalso see that with the `continued\\' message when you put something into\nthe background, and again at the end with the `done\\' message which\ntells you a background job is finished. The `%\\' can take other\nforms; the most common is to follow it by the name of a command, such as\n`%more\\' in this case. The forms %+ and %- refer to the most\nrecent and second most recent jobs --- the `+\\' in the\n`suspended\\' message is telling you that the more job could be\nreferred to like that.\nMost of the job control commands will actually assume you are talking\nabout `%+\\' if you don\\'t give an argument, so assuming I hadn\\'t\nstarted any other commands in the background, I could just have put\n`fg\\' at the end of the sequence of commands above. This actually\ncuts both ways: fg is the default operation on jobs referred to with\nthe `%\\' notation, so just typing `%1\\' with no command name would\nhave worked, too.\nYou can jog your memory about what\\'s going on with the `jobs\\'\ncommand. It looks like a series of messages of the form beginning with\nthe number in square brackets; usually the jobs will either be\n`running\\' or `suspended\\'. This will tell you the numbers you need.\nOne other useful thing you can do with a job is to tell the shell to\nforget about it. This is only really useful if it is already running in\nthe background; then you can run `disown\\' with the job identifier.\nIt\\'s useful for jobs you want to continue after you\\'ve logged out, as\nwell as jobs that have their own windows which you can therefore control\ndirectly. With disowned jobs, the shell doesn\\'t warn you that they are\nstill there when you log out. You can actually disown a background job\nwhen you start it by putting `&|\\' or `&!\\' at the end of the line\ninstead of simply `&\\'. Note that if the job was suspended when you\ndisowned it, it will stay disowned; this is pretty pointless, so you\nprobably should run `bg\\' on it first.\nThe next most likely thing you want to do with a job is kill it, or\nmaybe suspend it when it\\'s already in the background and you can\\'t\njust type ^Z. This is where the kill builtin comes in. There\\'s more\nto this than there is to the builtins mentioned above. First, you can\nuse kill with other processes that weren\\'t started from the current\nshell. In that case, you would use a number to identify it, with no %\n--- that\\'s why the %\\'s were there in the other cases. Of course,\nyou need to find out the number; the usual way is with the ps command,\nwhich is not a builtin but which appears on all UNIX-like systems. As a\nstupid example, here I start a disowned process which does very little,\nlook for it, then kill it:\n  % sleep 60 &|\n  % ps -f\n  UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\n  pws        623   614  0 22:12 pts/0    00:00:00 zsh\n  pws       8613   623  0 23:12 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep 60\n  pws       8615   623  0 23:12 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f\n  % kill 8613\n  % ps -f\n  UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\n  pws        623   614  0 22:12 pts/0    00:00:00 zsh\n  pws       8616   623  0 23:12 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f\nThe process has disappeared the second time I look. Notice that in the\nusual lugubrious UNIX way the shell didn\\'t bother to tell you the\nprocess had been killed; however, it will report an error if it failed\nto send it the signal. Sending it the signal is all the shell cares\nabout; the shell won\\'t warn if you if the process decided it didn\\'t\nwant to die when told to, so it\\'s still a good idea to check.\nSometimes you want to wait for a process to exit; the wait builtin can\ndo this, and like kill can take a process number as well as a job\nnumber. However, that\\'s a bit deceptive --- you can\\'t actually wait\nfor a process which wasn\\'t started directly from the shell. Indeed, the\nmechanism for waiting is all bound up with the way UNIX handles\nprocesses; unless its parent waits for it, a process becomes a\n`zombie\\' and hangs around until the system\\'s foster parent, the\n`init\\' process (always process number 1) waits for it instead. It\\'s\nall a little bit baroque, but for the shell user, wait just means you\ncan hang on until something you started has finished. Indeed, that\\'s\nhow foreground processes work: the shell in effect uses the internal\nversion of wait to hang around until the job exits. (Well, actually\nthat\\'s a lie; the system wakes it up from whatever it\\'s doing to tell\nit a child has finished, so all it has to do is doze off to wait.)\nFurthermore, you can wait for a process even if job control isn\\'t\nrunning. Job control, basically anything involving those %\\'s, is only\nuseful when you are sitting at a terminal fiddling with commands; it\ndoesn\\'t operate when you run scripts, say. Then the shell has much less\nfreedom in how to control its jobs, but it can still wait for a\nbackground process, and it can still use kill on a process if it knows\nits number. For this purpose, the shell stores the ID of the last\nprocess started in the background in the parameter $!; there\\'s\nprobably a good reason for the `!\\', but I don\\'t know what it is.\nThis happens regardless of job control.\nSignals\\\nThe kill command can do a good deal more than just kill a process.\nThat is the default action, which is why the command has that name. But\nwhat it\\'s really doing is sending a `signal\\' to a process. Signals\nare the simplest way of communicating to another process; in fact, they\nare about the only simple way if you haven\\'t made special arrangements\nfor the process to read messages from you. Signal names are written like\nSIGINT, SIGTSTP, SIGKILL; to send a particular signal to a\nprocess, you remove the SIG, stick a hyphen in front, and use that as\nthe first argument to kill, e.g.:\n  kill -KILL 8613\nSome of the things you already know about are actually doing just that.\nWhen you type ^C to stop a process, you are actually sending it a\nSIGINT for `interrupt\\', as if you had done\n  kill -INT 8613\nThe usual signal sent by kill is not, as you might have guessed,\nSIGKILL, but actually SIGTERM for `terminate\\'; SIGKILL is\nstronger as the process can\\'t block that signal, as it can with many\n(we\\'ll see how the shell can do that in a moment). It\\'s familiar to\nUNIX hackers as `kill -9\\', because all the signals also have\nnumbers. You can see the list of signals in zsh by doing:\n  % print $signals\n  EXIT HUP INT QUIT ILL TRAP ABRT BUS FPE KILL USR1\n  SEGV USR2 PIPE ALRM TERM STKFLT CLD CONT STOP TSTP\n  TTIN TTOU URG XCPU XFSZ VTALRM PROF WINCH POLL PWR\n  UNUSED ZERR DEBUG\nYour list will probably be different from mine; this is for Linux, and\nthe list is very system-specific, even though the first nine are\ngenerally the same, and many of the others are virtually always present.\nActually, SIGEXIT is an invention by the shell for you to allow the\nshell to do something when a function exits (see the section on\n`traps\\' below); you can\\'t actually use `kill -EXIT\\'. Thus\nSIGHUP is the first real signal, and indeed that\\'s number one, so you\nhave to shift the contents of $signals along one to get the right\nnumbers. SIGTERM and SIGINT usually have the same effect, stopping\nthe process, unless that has decided to handle the signal some other\nway.\nThe last two signals are bogus, too: SIGZERR is to allow the shell to\ndo something on an error (non-zero exit status), while with SIGDEBUG\nyou can do it on every command. Again, the `something\\' to be executed\nis a `trap\\', as I\\'ll discuss in a short while.\nTyping ^Z to suspend a process actually sends the process a SIGTSTP\n(terminal stop, since it usually comes from the terminal), while\nSIGSTOP is similar but usually doesn\\'t come from a terminal. Even\nrestarting a process as with bg sends it a signal, in this case\nSIGCONT. It seems a bit odd to signal a process to restart; why can\\'t\nthe operating system just restart it when you ask? The real answer is\nprobably that signals provide an easy way for you to talk to the\noperating system without grovelling around in the dirt too much.\nBefore I talk about how you make the shell handle signals it receives,\nthere is one extra oddment: the suspend builtin effectively sends the\nshell a signal to suspend it, as if you\\'d typed ^Z, though as you\\'ve\nprobably found by now that doesn\\'t suspend the shell itself. It\\'s only\nuseful to do this if the shell is running under some other programme,\nelse there\\'s no way of restoring it and suspending is effectively the\nsame as exiting the shell. For this reason, the shell won\\'t let you\ncall suspend in a login shell, because it assumes that is running as\nthe top level (though in the previous chapter you learnt there\\'s\nactually nothing that special about login shells; you can start one just\nwith `zsh -l\\'). If you\\'re logged in remotely via rsh or ssh,\nit\\'s usually more convenient to use the keystrokes `~^Z\\' which\nthose define, rather than zsh\\'s mechanism; they have to be at the\nbeginning of a line, so hit return first if necessary. This returns you\nto your local terminal; you can resume the remote login with `fg\\'\njust like any other programme.\nTraps\\\nThe way of making the shell handle signals is called `traps\\'. There\nare actually two mechanisms for this. I\\'ll present the more standard\none and then talk about the advantages and drawbacks of the other one at\nthe end.\nThe standard version (shared with other shells) is via the `trap\\'\nbuiltin. The first argument is a chunk of shell code to execute, which\nobviously needs to be quoted when you pass it as an argument, and the\nremaining arguments are a list of signals to handle, minus the SIG\nprefix. So:\n  trap \"echo I\\\\'m trapped.\" INT\ntells the shell what to do on SIGINT, i.e. ^C. Note the extra layer\nof quoting: the double quotes surround the code, so that when they are\nstripped trap sees the chunk\n  echo I\\'m trapped\nUsually the shell would abort what it was doing and return to the main\nprompt when you hit ^C. Now, however, it will simply print the message\nand carry on. You can try this, for example, with\n  read line\nIf you hit ^C while it\\'s waiting for input, you\\'ll see the message\ngo up, but the shell will still wait for you to type a line.\nA warning about this: ^C is only trapped within the shell itself. If\nyou start up an external programme, it will have its own mechanism for\nhandling signals, and if it usually aborts on ^C it still will. But\nthere\\'s a sting in the tail: do\n  cat\nwhich waits for input to output again (you need to use ^D to exit\nnormally). If you type ^C here, the command will be aborted, as I said\n--- but you still get the message `I'm trapped\\'. That\\'s because\nthe shell is able to tell that the command got that particular signal,\nand calls the trap when the cat exits. Not all shells do this;\nfurthermore, some commands which handle signals themselves won\\'t give\nthe shell enough information to know that a signal arrived, and in that\ncase the trap won\\'t be called. Such commands are usually the more\nsophisticated things like editors or screen managers or whatever; you\njust have to find out by trial and error.\nYou can also make the shell ignore the signal completely. To do this,\nthe first argument should be an empty string:\n  trap '' INT\nNow ^C will have no effect, and this time the effect is passed on\ndirectly to commands called from the shell --- try the cat example\nand you won\\'t be able to interrupt it; type ^D or use the lesser\nknown but more powerful ^\\ (control with backslash), which sends\nSIGQUIT. If it hasn\\'t been disabled, this will also produce a file\ncore, which contains debugging information about what the programme\nwas doing when it exited --- never call your own files core. You can\ntrap SIGQUIT too, if you want. (The shell itself usually ignores\nSIGQUIT; it\\'s only useful for external commands.)\nNow the other sort of trap. I could have written for the first example:\n  TRAPINT() {\n    print I\\'m trapped.\n  }\nAs you can see, this is just a function: functions beginning TRAP are\nspecial. However, it\\'s a real function too; you can call it by hand\nwith the command `TRAPINT\\', and it will run perfectly happily with no\nfunny side effects.\nThere is a difference between the way the two types work. In the\n`trap\\' sort of trap, the code is just evaluated just as if it\nappeared as instructions to the shell at the point where the trap\nhappened. So if you were in a function, you would see the environment of\nthat function with its local variables; if you set a local variable with\ntypeset, it would be visible in the function just as if it were\ncreated there.\nHowever, in the function type of trap, the code is provided with its own\nfunction environment. Now if you use typeset the parameter created is\nlocal only to the trap. In most cases, that\\'s all the difference there\nis; it\\'s up to you to decide which is more convenient. As you can see,\nthe function type of trap doesn\\'t require the extra layer of quoting,\nso looks a little smarter. Conveniently, the `trap\\' command on its\nown lists all traps in the form of the shell code you\\'d need to\nrecreate them, and you can see which sort is which.\nThere are two cases where the difference sticks out. One is that the\nfunction type has some extra wiring to allow you both to trap a signal,\nand pretend to anyone watching that the shell didn\\'t handle it. An\nexample will show this:\n  TRAPINT() {\n    print \"Signal caught, stopping anyway.\"\n    return $(( 128 + $1 ))\n  }\nThat second line may look as rococo as the Amalienburg, but it\\'s\nmeaning is this: $1, the first argument to the function, is set to the\nnumber of the signal. In this case it will be 2 because that\\'s the\nstandard number for SIGINT. That means the arithmetic substitution\n$((...)) returns 130, the command `return 130\\' is executed, and\nthe function returns with status 130. Returning with non-zero status is\nspecial in function traps: it tells the shell you want to abort the\nsurrounding command even though the trap was handled, and that you want\nthe status associated with that to be 130. It so happens that this is\nhow UNIX handles returns from normal traps. Without setting a trap, do\n  % cat\n  ^C\n  % print $?\nand you\\'ll see that this, too, has given the status 130, 128 plus the\nvalue of SIGINT. So if you do have the trap set, you\\'ll see the\nmessage, but the command will abort --- even if it was running inside\nthe shell.\nTry\n  % read line\n  ^C\nto see that happening. If you look at the status in $? you\\'ll find\nit\\'s actually 1, not 130; that\\'s because the read command, when it\naborted, overrode the return value from the trap. But it does that with\nan untrapped ^C, too, so that\\'s not really an exception to what I\\'ve\njust said.\nIf you\\'ve been paying attention, you\\'ll realise that traps set with\nthe trap builtin can\\'t do it in quite this way, because the function\nthey return from would be whatever function you were in. You can see\nthat:\n  trap 'echo Returning...; return;' INT\n  fn() {\n    print In fn...\n    read param\n    print Leaving fn..\n  }\nIf you run fn and hit ^C, the signal is trapped and the message\nprinted, but because of the return, the shell quits fn immediately\nand you don\\'t see the final message. If you missed out the\n`return;\\' (try it), the shell would carry on with the rest of fn\nafter you typed something to read. Of course you can use this\nmechanism to leave functions after trapping a signal; it just so happens\nthat in this case the mechanism with TRAPINT is a little closer to\nwhat untrapped signals do and hence a little neater.\nOne final flourish of late Baroque splendour: the trap for SIGEXIT,\nthe one called when a function (or the shell itself, in fact) exits is a\nbit special because in the case of exiting a function it will be called\nin the environment of the calling function. So if you need to do\nsomething like set a local variable for an enclosing function you can\nhave\n  trap 'typeset param_in_enclosing_func=value' EXIT\ndo it for you; you couldn\\'t do that with TRAPEXIT because the code\nwould have its own function, so that even though it would be called\nafter the first function exited, it wouldn\\'t run directly in the\nenclosing one but in a separate TRAPEXIT function. You can even set an\nEXIT trap for the enclosing function by defining a nested\n`trap .. EXIT\\' inside that trap itself.\nI lied, because there is one more special thing about TRAPEXIT: it\\'s\nalways reset after you exit a function and the trap itself has been\ncalled. Most traps just hang around until you explicitly unset them.\nThere is an option, LOCAL_TRAPS, which makes traps set inside\nfunctions as well insulated as possible from those outside, or inside\ndeeper functions. In other words, the old trap is saved and then\nrestored when you exit the function; the scoping works pretty much like\nthat for typeset, and in the same way traps for the enclosing scope,\napart from any for EXIT, remain in effect inside a function unless you\nexplicitly override them; and, again in the same way, if you unset it\ninside the function it will still be restored on exit.\nLOCAL_TRAPS is the fixed behaviour of some other shells. In zsh,\nwithout the option set:\n  trap 'echo Hi.' INT\n  fn() {\n     trap 'echo Bye.' INT\n  }\nCalling fn simply replaces the trap defined outside the function with\nthe one defined inside while:\n  trap 'echo Hi.' INT\n  fn() {\n     setopt localtraps\n     trap 'echo Bye.' INT\n  }\nputs the original `Hi\\' trap back after the function exits.\nI haven\\'t told you how to unset a trap for good: the answer is\n trap - INT\nAs you would guess, you can use unfunction with function-type traps;\nthat will correctly remove the trap as well as deleting the function.\nHowever, `trap -\\' works with both, so that\\'s the recommended way.\nLimits on processes\\\nOne other way that jobs started by the shell can be controlled is by\nusing limits. These are actually limits set by the operating system, but\nthe shell gives you a way of controlling them: the limit and unlimit\ncommands. Type `limit\\' on its own to see a summary. I get:\n  cputime         unlimited\n  filesize        unlimited\n  datasize        unlimited\n  stacksize       8MB\n  coredumpsize    0kB\n  memoryuse       unlimited\n  maxproc         2048\n  descriptors     1024\n  memorylocked    unlimited\n  addressspace    unlimited\nwhere the item on the left of each line is what is being limited, and on\nthe right is the value. The manual page to look at, at least on Linux is\nfor the function getrusage; that\\'s the function the shell is calling\nwhen you run limit or unlimit.\nIn this case, the items are:\ncputime\n:   the total CPU time used by a process\nfilesize\n:   maximum size of a file\ndatasize\n:   the maximum size of data in use by a programme\nstacksize\n:   the maximum size of the stack, which is the area of memory used to\n    store information during function calls\ncoredumpsize\n:   the maximum size of a core file, which is an image of memory left\n    by a programme that crashes, allowing you to debug it with gdb,\n    dbx, ddd or some other debugger\nmemoryuse\n:   the maximum main memory, i.e. programme memory which is in active\n    use and hasn\\'t been `swapped out\\' to disk\nmaxproc\n:   the maximum number of simultaneous processes\ndescriptors\n:   the maximum number of simultaneously open files (`descriptors\\' are\n    the internal mechanism for referring to an open file on UNIX-like\n    systems)\nmemorylocked\n:   the maximum amount of memory locked in (I don\\'t know what that is,\n    either)\naddressspace\n:   the total amount of virtual memory, i.e. any memory whether it is\n    main memory, or refers to somewhere on a disk, or indeed anything\n    else.\nYou may well see other names; the shell decides when it is compiled what\nlimits are supported by the system.\nOf those, the one I use most commonly is coredumpsize: sometimes when\nI\\'m debugging a file I want a crashed programme to produce a `core\\'\nfiles so I can run gdb or dbx on it (`unlimit coredumpsize\\'),\nwhile other times they are just untidy (`limit coredumpsize 0\\').\nProbably you would only alter any of the others if you knew there was a\nproblem, for example a number-crunching programme used so much memory\nthat the rest of the system was badly affected and you wanted to limit\ndatasize to 64 megabyte or whatever. You could write this as:\n  limit datasize 64m\nThere is a distinction made between `hard\\' and `soft\\' limits. Both\nhave the same effect on programmes, but you can remove or reduce\n`soft\\' limits, while only the superuser (the system administrator\\'s\nlogin, root) can do that to `hard\\' limits. Usually, therefore, limit\nand unlimit manipulate soft limits; to show or set hard limits, give\nthe option -h. If I do `limit -h\\', I get the same list of limits\nas above, but with stacksize and coredumpsize unlimited --- that\nmeans I can reduce or remove the limits on those if I want, they\\'re\njust set for my own convenience.\nWhy is stacksize set in this way? As I said, it refers to the memory\nin which the functions in programmes store variables and any other local\ninformation. If one function calls another, it uses more memory. You can\nget into a situation where functions call themselves recursively and\nthere is no way out until the machine runs out of memory; limiting\nstacksize prevents this. You can actually see this with zsh itself\n(probably better not to try this if you\\'d rather the shell you\\'re\nrunning didn\\'t crash):\n  % fn() { fn; }\n  % fn\ndefines a function which keeps calling itself. To do this, all the\nfunctions inside zsh are calling themselves as well, using more and\nmore stack memory. Actually, zsh uses other forms of memory inside each\nfunction and my version of zsh crashes due to exhaustion of that memory\ninstead. However, it depends on the system how this works out.\nTimes\\\nOne way of returning information on process resources is with the\n`times\\' command. It simply shows the total CPU time used by the\nshell and by the programmes called for it --- in that order, and\nwithout description, so you need to remember. On each line, the first\nnumber is the time spent in user space and the second is the time spent\nin system space. If you\\'re not concerned about the details of\nprogrammes the difference is pretty irrelevant, but if you are, then the\ndifference is very roughly that between the time spent in the code you\nactually see before you compile a programme, and the time spent in\n`hidden\\' code where the system is doing something for you. It\\'s not\nsuch an obvious distinction, because many library routines, such as\nmathematical functions, are run in user mode as no privileged access to\ninternal bits of the system is required. Typically, system time is\nconcerned with the details of input and output --- though even there\nit\\'s not so simple, because the C output routines printf, puts,\nfread and others have user mode code which then calls the system\nroutines read, write and so on.\nYou can measure the time taken by a particular external command by\nputting `time\\', in the singular this time, in front of it; this is\nessentially another precommand modifier, and is a shell reserved word\nrather than a builtin. This gives fairly obvious information. You can\nspecify the information using the $TIMEFMT parameter, which has its\nown percent escapes, different from the ones used in prompts. It exists\npartly because the shell allowed you to access all sorts of other\ninformation about the process which ran, such as `page faults\\' ---\noccasions when the system had to fetch a part of the programme or data\nfrom disk because it wasn\\'t in the main memory. However, that\ndisappeared because it was too much work to convert the feature to\nconfigure itself automatically for different operating systems. It may\nbe time to resurrect it.\nYou can also force the time to be shown automatically by setting the\nparameter $REPORTTIME; if a command runs for more than this many\nseconds, the $TIMEFMT output will be shown automatically.\n[]{#l40}\n3.2.9: Terminals, users, etc.\nWatching for other users\\\nAlthough this is more associated with parameters than builtins, the\n`log\\' command will tell you whether any of a group of people you\nwant to watch out for have logged in or out. To use this, you set the\n$watch array parameter to a list of user names, or `all\\' for\neveryone, or `notme\\' for everyone except yourself. Even if you\ndon\\'t use log, any changes will be reported just before the shell\nprints a prompt. It will be printed using the $WATCHFMT parameter:\nonce again, this takes its own set of percent escapes, listed in the\nzshparam manual.\nttyctl\\\nThere is a command ttyctl which is designed to keep badly behaved\nexternal commands from messing up the terminal settings. Most programmes\nare careful to restore any settings they change, but there are\nexceptions. After `ttyctl -f\\', the terminal is frozen; zsh will\nrestore the settings, no matter what an external programme does with it.\nThis includes deliberate attempts to change the terminal settings with\nthe `stty\\' command, so the default is unfrozen, `ttyctl -u\\'.\n[]{#l41}\n3.2.10: Syntactic oddments\nThis section collects together a few builtins which, rather than\ncontrolling the behaviour of some feature of the shell, have some other\nspecial effect.\nControlling programme flow\\\nThe four functions here are exit, return, break, continue and\nsource or .: they determine what the shell does next. You\\'ve met\nexit --- leave the shell altogether --- and return --- leave\nthe current function. Be very careful not to confuse them. Calling\nexit in a shell function is usually bad:\n  % fn() { exit; }\n  % fn\nThis makes you entire shell session go away, not just the function. If\nyou write C programmes, you should be very familiar with both, although\nthere is one difference in this case: return at the top level in an\ninteractive shell actually does nothing, rather than leaving the shell\nas you might expect. However, in a script, return outside a function\ndoes cause the entire script to stop. The reason for this is that zsh\nallows you to write autoloaded functions in the same form as scripts, so\nthat they can be used as either; this wouldn\\'t work if return did\nnothing when the file was run as a script. Other shells don\\'t do this:\nreturn does nothing at the top level of a script, as well as\ninteractively. However, other shells don\\'t have the feature that\nfunction definition files can be run as scripts, either.\nThe next two commands, break and continue, are to do with constructs\nlike `if\\'-blocks and loops, and it will be much easier if I\nintroduce them when I talk about those below. They will also already be\nfamiliar to C programmers. (If you are a FORTRAN programmer, however,\ncontinue is not the statement you are familiar with; it is instead\nequivalent to CYCLE in FORTRAN90.)\nThe final pair of commands are . and source. They are similar to one\nanother and cause another file to be read as a stream of commands in the\ncurrent shell --- not as a script, for which a new shell would be\nstarted which would finish at the end of the script. The two are\nintended for running a series of commands which have some effect on the\ncurrent shell, exactly like the startup files. Indeed, it\\'s a very\ncommon use to have a call to one or other in a startup file; I have in\nmy ~/.zshrc\n  [[ -f ~/.aliasrc ]] && . ~/.aliasrc\nwhich tests if the file ~/.aliasrc exists, and if so runs the commands\nin it; they are treated exactly as if they had appeared directly at that\npoint in .zshrc.\nNote that your $path is used to find the file to read from; this is a\nlittle surprising if you think of this as like a script being run, since\nzsh doesn\\'t search for a script, it uses the name exactly as you gave\nit. In particular, if you don\\'t have `.\\' in your $path and you\nuse the form `.\\' rather than `source\\' you will need to say\nexplicitly when you want to source a file in the current directory:\n  . ./file\notherwise it won\\'t be found.\nIt\\'s a little bit like running a function, with the file as the\nfunction body. Indeed, the shell will set the positional parameters $*\nin just the same way. However, there\\'s a crucial difference: there is\nno local parameter scope. Any variables in a sourced file, as in one of\nthe startup files, are in the same scope as the point from which it was\nstarted. You can, therefore, source a file from inside a function and\nhave the parameters in the sourced file local, but normally the only way\nof having parameters only for use in a sourced file is to unset them\nwhen you are finished.\nThe fact that both . and source exist is historical: the former\ncomes from the Bourne shell, and the latter from the C shell, which\nseems deliberately to have done everything differently. The point noted\nabove, that source always searches the current directory (and searches\nit first), is the only difference.\nRe-evaluating an expression\\\nSometimes it\\'s very useful to take a string and run it as if it were a\nset of shell commands. This is what eval does. More precisely, it\nsticks the arguments together with spaces and calls them. In the case of\nsomething like\n  eval print Hello.\nthis isn\\'t very useful; that\\'s no different from a simple\n  print Hello.\nThe difference comes when what\\'s on the command line has something to\nbe expanded, like a parameter:\n  param='print Hello.'\n  eval $param\nHere, the $param is expanded just as it would be for a normal command.\nThen eval gets the string `print Hello.\\' and executes it as shell\ncommand line. Everything --- really everything --- that the shell\nwould normally do to execute a command line is done again; in effect,\nit\\'s run as a little function, except that no local context for\nparameters is created. If this sounds familiar, that\\'s because it\\'s\nexactly the way traps defined in the form\n  trap 'print Hello.' EXIT\nare called. This is one simple way out of the hole you can sometimes get\nyourself into when you have a parameter which contains the name of\nanother parameter, instead of some data, and you want to get your hands\non the data:\n  # somewhere above...\n  origdata='I am data.'\n  # but all you know about is\n  paramname=origdata\n  # so to extract the data you can do...\n  eval data=\\$$paramname\nNow $data contains the value you want. Make sure you understand the\nseries of expansions going on: this sort of thing can get very\nconfusing. First the command line is expanded just as normal. This turns\nthe argument to eval into `data=$origdata\\'. The `$\\' that\\'s\nstill there was quoted by a backslash; the backslash was stripped and\nthe `$\\' left; the $paramname was evaluated completely separately\n--- quoted characters like the \\$ don\\'t have any effect on\nexpansions --- to give origdata. Eval calls the new line\n`data=$origdata\\' as a command in its own right, with the now obvious\neffect. If you\\'re even slightly confused, the best thing to do is\nsimply to quote everything you don\\'t want to be immediately expanded:\n  eval 'data=$'$paramname\nor even\n  eval 'data=${'$paramname'}'\nmay perhaps make your intentions more obvious.\nIt\\'s possible when you\\'re starting out to confuse `eval\\' with the\n`...`  and $(...) commands, which also take the command in the\nmiddle `...\\' and evaluate it as a command line. However, these two\n(they\\'re identical except for the syntax) then insert the output of\nthat command back into the command line, while eval does no such\nthing; it has no effect at all on where input and output go. Conversely,\nthe two forms of command substitution don\\'t do an extra level of\nexpansion. Compare:\n  % foo='print bar'\n  % eval $foo\n  bar\nwith\n  % foo='print bar'\n  % echo $($foo)\n  zsh: command not found: print bar\nThe $(...) substitution took $foo as the command line. As you are\nnow painfully aware, zsh doesn\\'t split scalar parameters, so this was\nturned into the single word `print bar\\', which isn\\'t a command. The\nblank line is `echo\\' printing the empty result of the failed\nsubstitution.\n[]{#l42}\n3.2.11: More precommand modifiers: exec, noglob\nSometimes you want to run a command instead of the shell. This\nsometimes happens when you write a shell script to process the arguments\nto an external command, or set parameters for it, then call that\ncommand. For example:\n  export MOZILLA_HOME=/usr/local/netscape\n  netscape \"$@\"\nRun as a script, this sets an environment variable, then starts\nnetscape. However, as always the shell waits for the command to\nfinish. That\\'s rather wasteful here, since there\\'s nothing more for\nthe shell to do; you\\'d rather it simply magically turned into the\nnetscape command. You can actually do this:\n  export MOZILLA_HOME=/usr/local/netscape\n  exec netscape \"$@\"\n`exec\\' tells the shell that it doesn\\'t need to wait; it can just\nmake the command to run replace the shell. So this only uses a single\nprocess.\nNormally, you should be careful not to use exec interactively, since\nnormally you don\\'t want the shell to go away. One legitimate use is to\nreplace the current zsh with a brand new one if (say) you\\'ve set a\nwhole load of options you don\\'t like and want to restore the ones you\nusually have on startup:\n  exec zsh\nOr you may have the bad taste to start a completely different shell\naltogether. Conversely, a good piece of news about exec is that it is\ncommon to all shells, so you can use it from another shell to start zsh\nin the way I\\'ve just shown.\nLike `command\\' and `builtin\\', `exec\\' is a `precommand\nmodifier\\' in that it alters the way a command line is interpreted.\nHere\\'s one more:\n  noglob print *\nIf you\\'ve remembered what `glob\\' means, this is all fairly obvious.\nIt instructs the shell not to turn the `*\\' into a list of all the\nfiles in the directory, but instead to let well alone. You can do this\nby quoting the `*\\', of course; often noglob is used as part of an\nalias to set up commands where you never need filename generation and\ndon\\'t want to have to bother quoting everything. However, note that\nnoglob has no effect on any other type of expansion: parameter\nexpansion and backquote (`....` ) expansion, for example, happen as\nnormal; the only thing that doesn\\'t is turning patterns into a list of\nmatching files. So it doesn\\'t take away the necessity of knowing the\nrules of shell expansion. If you need that, the best thing to do is to\nuse read or vared (see below) to read a line into a parameter, which\nyou pass to your function:\n  read -r param\n  print $param\nThe -r makes sure $param is the unadulterated input.\n[]{#l43}\n3.2.12: Testing things\nI told you in the last chapter that the right way to write tests in zsh\nwas using the `[[ ... ]]\\' form, and why. So you can ignore the two\nbuiltins `test\\' and `[\\', even though they\\'re the ones that\nresemble the Bourne shell. You can safely write\n  if [[ $foo = '' ]]; then\n    print The parameter foo is empty.  O, misery me.\n  fi\nor\n  if [[ -z $foo ]]; then\n    print Alack and alas, foo still has nothing in it.\n  fi\ninstead of monstrosities like\n  if test x$foo != x; then\n    echo The emptiness of foo.  Yet are we not all empty\\?\n  fi\nbecause even if $foo does expand to an empty string, which is what is\nimplied if the tests are true, `[[ ... ]]\\' remembers there was\nsomething there and gets the syntax right. Rather than a builtin, this\nis actually a reserved word --- in fact it has to be, to be\nsyntactically special --- but you probably aren\\'t too bothered about\nthe difference.\nThere are two sorts of tests, both shown above: those with three\narguments, and those with two. The three-argument forms all have some\ncomparison in the middle; in addition to `=\\' (or `==\\', which\nmeans the same here, and which according to the manual page we should be\nusing, though none of us does), there are `!=\\' (not equal), `\\',\n`>\\', `\\' and `>=\\'. All these do string comparisons, i.e.\nthey compare the sort order of the strings.\nSince there are better ways of sorting things in zsh, the `=\\' and\n`!=\\' forms are by far the most common. Actually, they do something a\nbit more than string comparison: the expression on the right can be a\npattern. The patterns understood are just the same as for matching\nfilenames, except that `/\\' isn\\'t special, so it can be matched by a\n`*\\'. Note that, because `=\\' and `!=\\' are treated specially\nby the shell, you shouldn\\'t quote the patterns: you might think that\nunless you do, they\\'ll be turned into file names, but they won\\'t. So\n  if [[ biryani = b* ]]; then\n    print Word begins with a b.\n  fi\nworks. If you\\'d written 'b*', including the quotes, it wouldn\\'t have\nbeen treated as a pattern; it would have tested for a string which was\nexactly the two letters `b*\\' and nothing else. Pattern matching like\nthis can be very powerful. If you\\'ve done any Bourne shell programming,\nyou may remember the only way to use patterns there was via the\n`case\\' construction: that\\'s still in zsh (see below), and uses the\nsame sort of patterns, but the test form shown above is often more\nuseful.\nThen there are other three-argument tests which do numeric comparison.\nRather oddly, these use letters rather than mathematical symbols:\n`-eq\\', `-lt\\' and `-le\\' compare if two numbers are equal,\nless than, or less than or equal, to one another. You can guess what\n`-gt\\' and `-ge\\' do. Note this is the other way round to Perl,\nwhich much more logically uses `==\\' to test for equality of numbers\n(not `=\\', since that\\'s always an assignment operator in Perl) and\n`eq\\' (minus the minus) to test for equality of strings.\nUnfortunately we\\'re now stuck with it this way round. If you are only\ncomparing numbers, it\\'s better to use the `(( ... ))\\' expression,\nbecause that has a proper understanding of arithmetic. However,\n  if [[ $number -gt 3 ]]; then\n    print Wow, that\\'s big\n  fi\nand\n  if (( $number > 3 )); then\n    print Wow, that\\'s STILL big\n  fi\nare essentially equivalent. In the second case, the status is zero\n(true) if the number in the expression was non-zero (sorry if I\\'m\nconfusing you again) and vice versa. This means that\n  if (( 3 )); then\n    print It seems that 3 is non-zero, Watson.\n  fi\nis a perfectly valid test. As in C, the test operators in arithmetic\nreturn 1 for true and 0 for false, i.e. `$number > 3\\' is 1 if\n$number is greater than 3 and 0 otherwise; the inversion to shell\nlogic, zero for true, only occurs at the final step when the expression\nhas been completely evaluated and the `(( ... ))\\' command returns.\nAt least with `[[ ... ]]\\' you don\\'t need to worry about the extra\nnegation; you can simply think in logical terms (although that\\'s hard\nenough for a lot of people).\nFinally, there are a few other odd comparisons in the three-argument\nform:\n  if [[ file1 -nt file2 ]]; then\n    print file1 is newer than file2\n  fi\ndoes the test implied by the example; there is also `-ot\\' to test\nfor an older file, and there is also the little-used `-ef\\' which\ntests for an `equivalent file\\', meaning that they refer to the same\nfile --- in other words, are linked; this can be a hard or a symbolic\nlink, and in the second case it doesn\\'t matter which of the two is the\nsymbolic link. (If you were paying attention above, you\\'ll know it\ncan\\'t possibly matter in the first case.)\nIn addition to these tests, which are pretty recognisable from most\nprogramming languages --- although you\\'ll just have to remember that\nthe `=\\' family compares strings and not numbers --- there are\nanother set which are largely peculiar to UNIXy scripting languages.\nThese are all in the form of a hyphen followed by a letter as the test,\nwhich always takes a single argument. I showed one: `-z $var\\' tests\nwhether `$var\\' has zero length. It\\'s opposite is `-n $var\\' which\ntests for non-zero length. Perhaps this is as good a time as any to\npoint out that the arguments to these commands can be any single word\nexpression, not just variables or filenames. You are quite at liberty to\ntest\n  if [[ -z \"$var is sqrt(`print bibble`)\" ]]; then\n    print Flying pig detected.\n  fi\nif you like. In fact, the tests are so eager to make sure that they only\nhave a one word argument that they will treat things like arrays, which\nusually return a whole set of words, as if they were in double quotes,\njoining the bits with spaces:\n  array=(two words)\n  if [[ $array = 'two words' ]]; then\n    print \"The array \\$array is OK.  O, joy.\"\n  fi\nApart from `-z\\' and `-n\\', most of the two-argument tests are to\ndo with files: `-e\\' tests that the file named next exists, whatever\ntype of file it is (it might be a directory or something weirder);\n`-f\\' tests if it exists and is a regular file (so it isn\\'t a\ndirectory or anything weird this time); `-x\\' tests whether you can\nexecute it. There are all sorts of others which are listed in the manual\npage for various properties of files. Then there are a couple of others:\n`-o \\' you\\'ve met and tests whether the option is set, and\n`-t \\' tests whether the file descriptor is attached to a\nterminal. A file descriptor is a number which for the shell must be\nbetween 0 and 9 inclusive (others may exist, but you can\\'t access them\ndirectly); 0 is the standard input, 1 the standard output, and 2 the\nchannel on which errors are usually printed. Hence `[[ -t 0 ]]\\'\ntests whether the input is coming from a terminal.\nThere are only four other things making up tests. `&&\\' and `||\\'\nmean logical `and\\' and `or\\', `!\\' negates the effect of a test,\nand parentheses `( ... )\\' can be used to surround a set of tests\nwhich are to be treated as one. These are all essentially the same as in\nC. So\n  if [[ 3 -gt 2 && ( me > you || ! -z bah ) ]]; then\n    print will I, won\\'t I...\n  fi\nwill, because 3 is numerically greater than 2; the expression in\nparentheses is evaluated and though `me\\' actually comes before `you\\'\nin the alphabet, so the first test fails, `-z bah\\' is false because\nyou gave it a non-empty string, and hence `! -z bah\\' is true. So\nboth sides of the `&&\\' are true and the test succeeds.\n[]{#l44}\n3.2.13: Handling options to functions and scripts\nIt\\'s often convenient to have your own functions and scripts process\nsingle-letter options in the way a lot of builtin commands (as well as a\ngreat many other UNIX-style commands) do. The shell provides a builtin\nfor this called `getopts\\'. This should always be called in some kind\nof loop, usually a `while\\' loop. It\\'s easiest to explain by\nexample.\n  testopts() {\n    # $opt will hold the current option\n    local opt\n    while getopts ab: opt; do\n      # loop continues till options finished\n      # see which pattern $opt matches...\n      case $opt in\n        (a)\n           print Option a set\n           ;;\n        (b)\n           print Option b set to $OPTARG\n           ;;\n    # matches a question mark\n    # (and nothing else, see text)\n        (\\?)\n           print Bad option, aborting.\n           return 1\n           ;;\n      esac\n    done\n    (( OPTIND > 1 )) && shift $(( OPTIND - 1 ))\n    print Remaining arguments are: $*\n  }\nThere\\'s quite a lot here if you\\'re new to shell programming. You might\nwant to read the stuff on structures like while and case below and\nthen come back and look at this. First let\\'s see what it does.\n  % testopts -b foo -a -- args\n  Option b set to foo\n  Option a set\n  Remaining arguments are: args\nHere\\'s what\\'s happening. `getopts ab: opt\\' is the argument to the\n`while\\'. That means that the getopts gets run; if it succeeds\n(returns status zero), then the loop after the `do\\' is run. When\nthat\\'s finished, the getopts command is run again, and so on until it\nfails (returns a non-zero status). It will do that when there are no\nmore options left on the command line. So the loop processes the options\none by one. Each time through, the number of the next argument to look\nat is left in the parameter $OPTIND, so this gradually increases;\nthat\\'s how getopts knows how far it has got.\nThe first argument to the getopts is `ab:\\'. That means `a\\' is\nan option which doesn\\'t take an argument, while `b\\' is an argument\nwhich takes a single argument, signified by the colon after it. You can\nhave any number of single-letter (or even digit) arguments, which are\ncase-sensitive; for example `ab:c:ABC:\\' are six different options,\nthree with arguments. If the option found has an argument, that is\nstored in the parameter $OPTARG; getopts then increments $OPTIND\nby however much is necessary, which may be 2 or just 1 since\n`-b foo\\' and `-bfoo\\' are both valid ways of giving the argument.\nIf an option is found, we use the `case\\' mechanism to find out what\nit was. The idea of this is simple, even if the syntax has the look of\nan 18th-century French chateau: the argument `$opt\\' is tested\nagainst all of the patterns in the `pattern)\\' lines until one\nmatches, and the commands are executed until the next `;;\\'. It\\'s\nthe shell\\'s equivalent of C\\'s `switch\\'. In this example, we just\nprint out what the getopts brought in. Note the last line, which is\ncalled if $opt is a question mark --- it\\'s quoted because `?\\'\non its own can stand for any single character. This is how getopts\nsignals an unknown option. If you try it, you\\'ll see that getopts\nprints its own error message, so ours was unnecessary: you can turn the\nformer off by putting a colon right at the start of the list of options,\nmaking it `:ab:\\' here.\nActually, having this last pattern as an unquoted `?\\' isn\\'t such\na bad idea. Suppose you add a letter to the list that getopts should\nhandle and forget to add a corresponding item in the case list for it.\nIf the last item matches any character, you will get the behaviour for\nan unhandled option, which is probably the best thing to do. Otherwise\nnothing in the case list will match, the shell will sail blithely on\nto the next call to getopts, and when you try to use the function with\nthe new option you will be left wondering quite what happened to it.\nThe last piece of the getopts jigsaw is the next line, which tests if\n$OPTIND is larger than 1, i.e. an option was found and $OPTIND was\nadvanced --- it is automatically set to 1 at the start of every\nfunction or script. If it was, the `shift\\' builtin with a numeric\nargument, but no array name, moves the positional parameters, i.e. the\nfunction\\'s arguments, to shift away the options that have been\nprocessed. The print in the next line shows you that only the\nremaining non-option arguments are left. You don\\'t need to do that\n--- you can just start using the remaining arguments from\n$argv[$OPTIND] on --- but it\\'s a pretty good way of doing it.\nIn the call, I showed a line with `-``-\\' in it: that\\'s the standard\nway of telling getopts that the options are finished; even if later\nwords start with a -, they are not treated as options. However,\ngetopts stops anyway when it reaches a word not beginning with\n`-\\', so that wasn\\'t necessary here. But it works anyway.\nYou can do all of what getopts does without that much difficulty\nwith a few extra lines of shell programming, of course. The best\nargument for using getopts is probably that it allows you to group\nsingle-letter options, e.g. `-abc\\' is equivalent to `-a -b -c\\'\nif none of them was defined to have an argument. In this case, getopts\nhas to remember the position inside the word on the command line for\nyou to call it next, since the `a\\' `b\\' and `c\\' still appear\non different calls. Rather unsatisfactorily, this is hidden inside the\nshell (as it is in other shells --- we haven\\'t fixed all of\neverybody else\\'s bad design decisions); you can\\'t get at it or reset\nit without altering $OPTIND. But if you read the small print at the\ntop of the guide, you\\'ll find I carefully avoided saying everything was\nsatisfactory.\nWhile we\\'re at it, why do blocks starting with `if\\' and `then\\'\nend with `fi\\', and blocks starting with `case\\' end with\n`esac\\', while those starting with `while\\' and `do\\' end with\n`done\\', not `elihw\\' (perfectly pronounceable in Welsh, after\nall) or `od\\'? Don\\'t ask me.\n[]{#l45}\n3.2.14: Random file control things\nWe\\'re now down into the odds and ends. If you know UNIX at all, you\nwill already be familiar with the umask command and its effect on file\ncreation, but as it is a builtin I will describe it here. Create a file\nand look at it:\n  % touch tmpfile\n  % ls -l tmpfile\n  -rw-r--r--    1 pws   pws    0 Jul 19 21:19 tmpfile\n(I\\'ve shortened the output line for the TeX version of this document.)\nYou\\'ll see that the permissions are read for everyone, write-only for\nthe owner. How did the command (touch, not a builtin, creates an empty\nfile if there was none, or simply updates the modification time of an\nexisting file) know what permissions to set?\n  % umask\n  022\n  % umask 077\n  % rm tmpfile; touch tmpfile\n  % ls -l tmpfile\n  -rw-------    1 pws   pws    0 Jul 19 21:22 tmpfile\numask was how it knew. It gives an octal number corresponding to the\npermissions which should not be given to a newly created file (only\nnewly created files are affected; operations on existing files don\\'t\ninvolve umask). Each digit is made up of a 4 for read, 2 for write, 1\nfor executed, in the same order that ls shows for permissions: user,\nthen group, then everyone else. (On this Linux/GNU-based system, like\nmany others, users have their own groups, so both are called `pws\\'.)\nSo my original `022\\' specified that everything should be allowed\nexcept writing for group and other, while `077\\' disallowed any\noperation by group and other. These are the two most common settings,\nalthough here `002\\' or `007\\' would be useful because of the way\ngroups are specific to users, making it easier to grant permission to\nspecific other users to write in my directories. (Except there aren\\'t\nany other users.)\nYou can also use chmod-like permission changing expressions in\numask. So\n  % umask go+rx\nwould restore group and other permissions for reading and executing,\nhence returning the mask to 022. Note that because it is adding\npermissions, just like chmod does, it is removing numbers from the\numask.\nYou might have wondered about execute permissions, since `touch\\'\ndidn\\'t give any, even where it was allowed by umask. That\\'s because\nonly operations which create executable programmes, such as running a\ncompiler and linker, set that bit; the normal way of opening a new file\n--- internally, the UNIX open function, with the O_CREAT flag set\n--- doesn\\'t touch it. For the same reason, if you create shell\nscripts which you want to be able to execute by typing the name, you\nhave to make them executable yourself:\n  % chmod +x myscript\nand, indeed, you can think of chmod as umask\\'s companion for files\nwhich already exist. It doesn\\'t need to be a builtin, because the files\nyou are operating on are external to zsh; umask, on the other hand,\noperates when you create a file from within zsh or any child process,\nso needs to be a builtin. The fact that it\\'s inherited means you can\nset umask before you start an editor, and files created by that editor\nwill reflect the permissions.\nNote that the value set by umask is also inherited and used by\nchmod. In the example of chmod I gave, I didn\\'t see which type of\nexecute permission to add; chmod looks at my umask and decides based\non that --- in other words, with 022, everybody would be allowed to\nexecute myscript, while with 077, only I would, because of the 1\\'s in\nthe number: (0+0+0)+(4+2+1)+(4+2+1). Of course, you can be explicit with\nchmod and say `chmod u+x myscript\\' and so on.\nSomething else that may or may not be obvious: if you run a script by\npassing it as an argument to the shell,\n  % zsh myscript\nwhat matters is read permission. That\\'s what the shell\\'s doing to\nthe script to find the commands, after all. Execute permission applies\nwhen the system (or, in some cases, including zsh, the parent shell\nwhere you typed `myscript\\') has to decide whether to find a shell to\nrun the script by itself.\n[]{#l46}\n3.2.15: Don\\'t watch this space, watch some other\nFinally for builtins, some things which really belong elsewhere. There\nare three commands you use to control the shell\\'s editor. These will be\ndescribed in chapter 4, where I talk all about\nthe editor.\nThe bindkey command allows you to attach a set of keystrokes to a\ncommand. It understands an abbreviated notation for the keystrokes.\n  % bindkey '^Xc' copy-prev-word\nThis binds the keystrokes consisting of Ctrl held down with x, then\nc, to the command which copies the previous word on the line to the\ncurrent position. The commands are listed in the zshzle manual page.\nbindkey can also do things with keymaps, which are a complete set of\nmappings between keys and commands like the one I showed.\nThe vared command is an extremely useful builtin for editing a shell\nvariable. Usually much the easiest way to change $path (or $PS1, or\nwhatever) is to run `vared path\\': note the lack of a `$\\', since\notherwise you would be editing whatever $path was expanded to. This is\nbecause very often you want to leave most of what\\'s there and just\nchange the odd character or word. Otherwise, you would end up doing this\nwith ordinary parameter substitutions, which are a lot more complicated\nand error prone. Editing a parameter is exactly like editing a command\nline, except without the prompt at the start.\nFinally, there is the zle command. This is the most mysterious, as it\noffers a fairly low-level interface to the line editor; you use it to\ndefine your own editing commands. So I\\'ll leave this alone for now.\n[]{#l47}\n3.2.16: And also\nThere is one more standard builtin that I haven\\'t covered: zmodload,\nwhich allows you to manipulate add-on packages for zsh. Many extras are\nsupplied with the shell which aren\\'t normally loaded to keep down the\nuse of memory and to avoid having too many rarely used builtins, etc.,\ngetting in the way. In the last chapter I will talk about some of these.\nTo be more honest, a lot of the stuff in between actually uses these\naddons, generically referred to as modules --- the line editor, zle,\nis itself a separate module, though heavily dependent on the main shell\n--- and you\\'ve probably forgotten I mentioned above using\n`zmodload zsh/mathfunc\\' to load mathematical functions.\n[]{#l48}\n3.3: Functions\nNow it\\'s time to look at functions in more detail. The various issues\nto be discussed are: loading functions, handling parameters, compiling\nfunctions, and repairing bike tyres when the rubber solution won\\'t\nstick to the surface. Unfortunately I\\'ve already used so much space\nthat I\\'ll have to skip the last issue, however topical it might be for\nme at the moment.\n[]{#l49}\n3.3.1: Loading functions\nWell, you know what happens now. You can define functions on the command\nline:\n  fn() {\n    print I am a function\n  }\nwhich you call under the name `fn\\'. As you type, the shell knows\nthat it\\'s in the middle of a function definition, and prompts you until\nyou get to the closing brace.\nAlternatively, and much more normally, you put a file called fn\nsomewhere in a directory listed in the $fpath array. At this point,\nyou need to be familiar with the KSH_AUTOLOAD option described in the\nlast chapter. From now on, I\\'m just going to assume your autoloadable\nfunction files contain just the body of the function, i.e.\nKSH_AUTOLOAD is not set. Then the file fn would contain:\n  print I am a function\nand nothing else.\nRecent versions of zsh, since 3.1.6, set up $fpath for you. It\ncontains two parts, although the second may have multiple directories.\nThe first is, typically, /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions, although\nthe prefix may vary. This is empty unless your system administrator has\nput something in it, which is what it\\'s there for.\nThe remaining part may be either a single directory such as\n/usr/local/share/zsh/3.1.9/functions, or a whole set of directories\nstarting with that path. It simply depends whether the person installing\nzsh wanted to keep all the functions in the same directory, or have them\nsorted according to what they do. These directories are full of\nfunctions. However, none of the functions is autoloaded automatically,\nso unless you specifically put `autoload ...\\' in a startup file, the\nshell won\\'t actually take any notice of them. As you\\'ll see, part of\nthe path is the shell version. This makes it very easy to keep multiple\nversions of zsh with functions which use features that may be different\nbetween the two versions. By the way, if these directories don\\'t exist,\nyou should check $fpath to see if they are in some other location, and\nif you can\\'t find any correspondence between what\\'s in $fpath and\nwhat\\'s on the disk even when you start the shell with zsh -f to\nsuppress loading of startup files, complain to the system administrator:\nhe or she has either not installed them properly, or has made\n/etc/zshenv stomp on $fpath, both of which are thoroughly evil\nthings to do. (/etc/zshrc, /etc/zprofile and /etc/zlogin\nshouldn\\'t stomp on $fpath either, of course. In fact, they shouldn\\'t\ndo very much; that\\'s up to the user.)\nOne point about autoload is the `-U\\' option. This turns off the\nuse of any aliases you have defined when the function is actually loaded\n--- the flag is remembered with the name of the function for future\nreference, rather than being interpreted immediately by the autoload\ncommand. Since aliases can pretty much redefine any command into any\nother, and are usually interpreted while a function is being defined or\nloaded, you can see that without this flag there is fair scope for\ncomplete havoc.\n   alias ls='echo Your ls command has been requisitioned.'\n   lsroot() {\n     ls -l /\n   }\n   lsroot\nThat\\'s not what the function writer intended. (Yes, I know it actually\nis, because I wrote it to show the problem, but that\\'s not what I\nmeant.) So -U is recommended for all standard functions, where you\nhave no easy way of telling quite what could be run inside.\nRecently, the functions for the new completion system (described in\nchapter 6) have been changing the fastest. They\neither begin with comp or an underscore, `_\\'. If the functions\ndirectory is subdivided, most of the subdirectories refer to this. There\nare various other classes of functions distributed with the shell:\n\nFunctions beginning zf are associated with zftp, a builtin system\nfor FTP transfers. Traditional FTP clients, ones which don\\'t use a\ngraphical interface, tend to be based around a set of commands on a\ncommand line --- exactly what zsh is good at. This also makes it\nvery easy to write macros for FTP jobs --- they\\'re just shell\nfunctions. This is described in the final chapter along with other\nmodules. It\\'s based around a single builtin, zftp, which is\nloaded from the module zsh/zftp.\n\nFunctions beginning prompt, which may be in the Prompts\nsubdirectory, are part of a `prompt themes\\' system which makes it\neasy for you to switch between preexisting prompts. You load it with\n`autoload -U promptinit; promptinit\\'. Then `prompt -h\\' will\ntell you what to do next. If you have new completion loaded (with\n`autoload -U compinit; compinit\\', what else) the arguments to\n`prompt\\' can be listed with ^D and completed with a TAB; they\nare various sorts of prompt which you may or may not like.\n\nFunctions with long names and hyphens, like predict-on and\nincremental-complete-word. These are editor functions; you use\nthem with\n  zle -N predict-on\n  bindkey  predict-on\nHere, the predict-on function automatically looks back in the\nhistory list for matching lines as you type. You should also bind\npredict-off, which is loaded when predict-on is first called.\nincremental-complete-word is a fairly simple attempt at showing\npossible completions for the current word as you type; it could do\nwith improving.\n\nEverything else; these may be in the Misc subdirectory. These are\na very mixed bag which you should read to see if you like any. One\nof the most useful is zed, which allows you to edit a small file\n(it\\'s really just a simple front-end to vared). The run-help\nfile shows you the sort of thing you might want to define for use\nwith the \\eh (run-help) keystroke. is-at-least is a function\nfor finding out if the version of the shell running is recent\nenough, assuming you know what version you need for a given feature.\nSeveral of the other functions refer to the old completion system\n--- which you won\\'t need, since you will be reading chapter\n6 and using the new completion system, of\ncourse.\n\n\nIf you have your own functions --- and if you use zsh a lot, you\nalmost certainly will eventually --- it\\'s a good idea to add your own\npersonal directory to the front of $fpath, so that everything there\ntakes precedence over the standard functions. That allows you to\noverride a completion function very easily, just by copying it and\nediting it. I tend to do something like this in my .zshenv:\n  [[ $fpath = *pws* ]] || fpath=(~pws/bin/fns $fpath)\nto protect against the possibility that the directory I want to add is\nalready there, in case I source that startup file again, and there are\nother similar ways. (You may well find your own account isn\\'t called\npws, however.)\nChances are you will always want your own functions to be autoloaded.\nThere is an easy way of doing this: put it just after the line I showed\nabove:\n  autoload ${fpath[1]}/*(:t)\nThe ${fpath[1]}/* expands to all the files in the directory at the\nhead of the $fpath array. The (:t) is a `glob modifier\\': applied\nto a filename generation pattern, it takes the tail (basename) of all\nthe files in the list. These are exactly the names of the functions you\nwant to autoload. It\\'s up to you whether you want the -U argument\nhere.\n[]{#l50}\n3.3.2: Function parameters\nI covered local parameters in some detail when I talked about typeset,\nso I won\\'t talk about that here. I didn\\'t mention the other parameters\nwhich are effectively local to a function, the ones that pass down the\narguments to the function, so here is more detail. They work pretty much\nidentically in scripts.\nThere are basically two forms. There is the form inherited from Bourne\nshell via Korn shell, with the typically uninformative names: $#,\n$*, $@ and the numerical parameters $1 etc. --- as high a number\nas the shell will parse is allowed, not just single digits. Then there\nis the form inherited from the C shell: $ARGC and $argv. I\\'ll\nmainly use the Bourne shell versions, which are far more commonly used,\nand come back to some oddities of the C shell variety at the end.\n$# tells you how many arguments were passed to the function, while\n$* gives those arguments as an array. This was the only array\navailable in the Bourne shell, otherwise there would probably have been\na more obvious way of doing it. To get the size and the number of\nelements of the array you don\\'t use ${#*} and ${*[1]} etc. (well,\nyou usually don\\'t --- zsh is typically permissive here), you use\n$1, $2. Despite the syntax, these are rather like ordinary array\nelements; if you refer to one off the end, you will get an empty string,\nbut no error, unless you have the option NO_UNSET set. It is this\nnot-quite array which gets shifted if you use the shift builtin\nwithout an argument: the old $1 disappears, the old $2 becomes $1,\nand so on, while $# is reduced by one. If there were no arguments\n($# was zero), nothing happens.\nThe form $@ is very similar to $*, and you can use it in place of\nthat in most contexts. There is one place where they differ. Let\\'s\ndefine a function which prints the number of its arguments, then the\narguments.\n  args() {\n    print $# $*\n  }\nNow some arguments. We\\'ll do this for the current shell --- it\\'s a\nslightly odd idea, that you can set the arguments for what\\'s already\nrunning, or that an interactive shell has arguments at all, but\nnonetheless it\\'s true:\n  set arguments to the shell\n  print $*\nsets $* and hence prints the message `arguments to the shell\\'. We\nnow pass these arguments on to the function in two different ways:\n  args $*\n  args $@\nThis outputs\n  4 arguments to the shell\n  4 arguments to the shell\n-- no surprises so far. Remember, too, that zsh doesn\\'t split words on\nspaces unless you ask it too. So:\n  % set 'one word'\n  % args $*\n  1 one word\n  % args $@\n  1 one word\nNow here\\'s the difference:\n  % set two words\n  % args \"$*\"\n  1 two words\n  % args \"$@\"\n  2 two words\nIn quotes, \"$*\" behaves as a normal array, joining the words with\nspaces. However, \"$@\" doesn\\'t --- it still behaves as if it was\nunquoted. You can\\'t see from the arguments themselves in this case, but\nyou can from the digit giving the number of arguments the function has.\nThis probably seems pretty silly. Why quote something to have it behave\nlike an unquoted array? The original answer lies back in Bourne shell\nsyntax, and relates to the vexed question of word splitting. Suppose we\nturn on Bourne shell behaviour, and try the example of a word with\nspaces again:\n  % setopt shwordsplit\n  % set 'one word'\n  % args $*\n  2 one word\n  % args $@\n  2 one word\n  % args \"$*\"\n  1 one word\n  % args \"$@\"\n  1 one word\nAha! This time \"$@\" kept the single word with the space intact. In\nother words, \"$@\" was a slightly primitive mechanism for suppressing\nsplitting of words, while allowing the splitting of arrays into\nelements. In zsh, you would probably quite often use $*, not \"$@\",\nsafe in the knowledge that nothing was split until you asked it to be;\nand if you wanted it split, you would use the special form of\nsubstitution ${=*} which does that:\n  % unsetopt shwordsplit\n  % args $*\n  1 one word\n  % args ${=*}\n  2 one word\n(I can\\'t tell you why the `=\\' was chosen for this purpose, except\nthat it consists of two split lines, or in an assignment it splits two\nthings, or something.) This works with any parameter, whether scalar or\narray, quoted or unquoted.\nHowever, that\\'s actually not quite the whole story. There are times\nwhen the shell removes arguments, because there\\'s nothing there:\n  % set hello '' there\n  % args $*\n  2 hello there\nThe second element of the array was empty, as if you\\'d typed\n  2=\n--- yes, you can assign to the individual positional parameters\ndirectly, instead of using set. When the array was expanded on the\ncommand line, the empty element was simply missed out altogether. The\nsame happens with all empty variables, including scalars:\n  % empty=\n  % args $empty\n  0\nBut there are times when you don\\'t want that, any more than you want\nword splitting --- you want all arguments passed just as you gave\nthem. This is another side effect of the \"$@\" form.\n  % args \"$@\"\n  3 hello there\nHere, the empty element was passed in as well. That\\'s why you often\nfind \"$@\" being used in zsh when wordsplitting is already turned off.\nAnother note: why does the following not work like the example with\n$*?\n  % args hello '' there\n  3 hello there\nThe quotes were kept here. Why? The reason is that the shell doesn\\'t\nelide an argument if there were quotes, even if the result was empty:\ninstead, it provides an empty string. So this empty string was passed as\nthe second argument. Look back at:\n  set hello '' there\nAlthough you probably didn\\'t think about it at the time, the same thing\nwas happening here. Only with the '``' did we get an empty string\nassigned to $2; later, this was missed out when passing $* to the\nfunction. The same difference occurs with scalars:\n  % args $empty\n  0\n  % args \"$empty\"\n  1\nThe $empty expanded to an empty string in each case. In the first case\nit was unquoted and was removed; this is like passing an empty part of\n$* to a command. In the second case, the quotes stopped that from\nbeing removed completely; this is similar to setting part of $* to an\nempty string using ''.\nThat\\'s all thoroughly confusing the first time round. Here\\'s a table\nto try and make it a bit clearer.\n                       |   Number of arguments\n                       |     if $* contains...\n                       |  (two words)\nExpression   Word      |       'one word'\non line   splitting?   |             empty string\n--------------------------------------------------\n$*             n       |     2     1     0\n$@             n       |     2     1     0\n\"$*\"           n       |     1     1     1\n\"$@\"           n       |     2     1     1\n                       |                    \n$*             y       |     2     2     0\n$@             y       |     2     2     0\n\"$*\"           y       |     1     1     1\n\"$@\"           y       |     2     1     1\n                       |                    \n${=*}          n       |     2     2     0\n${=@}          n       |     2     2     0\n\"${=*}\"        n       |     2     2     1\n\"${=@}\"        n       |     2     2     1\nOn the left is shown the expression to be passed to the function, and in\nthe three right hand columns the number of arguments the function will\nget if the positional parameters are set to an array of two words, a\nsingle word with a space in the middle, or a single word which is an\nempty string (the effect of `set -- '``'\\') respectively. The second\ncolumn shows whether word splitting is in effect, i.e. whether the\nSH_WORD_SPLIT option is set. The first four lines show the normal zsh\nbehaviour; the second four show the normal sh/ksh behaviour, with word\nsplitting turned on --- only the case where a word has a space in it\nchanges, and then only when no quotes are supplied. The final four show\nwhat happens when you use the `${=..}\\' method to turn on word\nsplitting, for convenience: that\\'s particularly simple, since it always\nforces words to be split, even inside quotation marks.\nI would recommend that anyone not wedded to the Bourne shell behaviour\nuse the top set as standard: in particular, `$*\\' for normal array\nbehaviour with removal of empty items, `\"$@\"\\' for normal array\nbehaviour with empty items left as empty items, and `\"$*\"\\' for\nturning arrays into single strings. If you need word-splitting, you\nshould use `${=*}\\' or `\"${=@}\"\\' for splitting with/without\nremoval of empty items (obviously there\\'s no counterpart to the\nquoted-array behaviour here). Then keep SH_WORD_SPLIT turned off. If\nyou are wedded to the Bourne shell behaviour, you\\'re on your own.\nIt\\'s a bug\\\nThere\\'s a bug in handling of the the form ${1+\"$@\"}. This looks\nrather an arcane and unlikely combination, but actually it is commonly\nused to get around a bug in some versions of the Bourne shell (which is\nnot in zsh): that \"$@\" generates a single empty argument if there are\nno arguments. The form shown tests whether there is a first argument,\nand if so substitutes \"$@\", else it doesn\\'t substitute anything,\navoiding the bug.\nUnfortunately, in zsh, when shwordsplit is set --- which is the time\nyou usually run across attempts like this to standardise the way\ndifferent shells work --- this will actually cause too much\nword-splitting. The way the shell is written at the moment, the embedded\n\"$@\" will force extra splitting on spaces inside the arguments. So if\nthe first argument is `one word\\', and shwordsplit is set,\n${1+\"$@\"} produces two words `one\\' and `word\\'.\nOliver Kiddle spotted a way of getting round this which has been adapted\nfor use in the GNU autoconf package: in your initialisation code, have\n  [ x$ZSH_VERSION != x ] && alias -g '${1+\"$@\"}'='\"$@\"'\nThis uses a global alias to turn ${1+\"$@\"} wherever it occurs as a\nsingle word into \"$@\" which doesn\\'t have the problem. Aliasing occurs\nso early in processing that the fact that most of the characters have a\nspecial meaning to the shell is irrelevant; the shell behaves as if it\nread in \"$@\". The only catch is that for this to work the script or\nfunction must use exactly the character string ${1+\"$@\"}, with no\nleading or trailing word characters (whitespace, obviously, or\ncharacters which terminate parsing such as `;\\' are all right). Some\nday, we may fix the underlying bug, but it\\'s not very easy with the way\nthe parameter substitution code is written at the moment.\nParameters inherited from csh\\\nThe final matter is the C-shell syntax. There are two extra variables\nbut, luckily, there is not much extra in the way of complexity. $ARGC\nis essentially identical to $#, and $argv corresponds to $*, but\nis a real array this time, so instead of $1 you have ${argv[1]} and\nso on. They use the convention that scalars used by the shell are all\nuppercase, while arrays are all lowercase. This feature is probably the\nonly reason anyone would need these variants. For example,\n${argv[2,-1]} means all arguments from the second to the last,\ninclusive: negative indices count from the end, and a comma indicates a\nslice of an array, so that ${argv[1,-1]} is always the same as the\nfull array. Otherwise, my advice would be to stick with the Bourne shell\nvariants, however cryptic they may look at first sight, for the usual\nreason that zsh isn\\'t really like the C shell and if you pretend it is,\nyou will come a cropper sooner or later.\nIt looks like you\\'re missing \"$@\", but actually you can do that with\n\"${argv[@]}\". This, like negative indices and slices, works with all\narrays.\nThere\\'s one slight oddity with $ARGC and $argv, which isn\\'t really\na deliberate feature of the shell at all, but just in case you run into\nit: although the values in them are of course local to functions, the\nvariables $ARGC and $argv themselves are actually treated like\nglobal variables. That means if you apply a typeset -g command to\nthem, it will affect the behaviour of $ARGC and $argv in all\nfunctions, even though they have different values. It\\'s probably not a\ngood idea to rely on this behaviour.\nnusubsect(Arguments to all commands work the same)\nI\\'ve been a little tricky here, because I\\'ve been talking about two\nlevels of functions at once: $* and friends as set in the current\nfunction, or even at the top level, as well as how they are passed down\nto commands such as my args function. Of course, in the second case\nthe same behaviour applies to all commands, not just functions. What I\nmean is, in\n  fn() {\n    cat $*\n    cat \"$*\"\n  }\nthe `cat\\' command will see the differences in behaviour between the\ntwo calls just as args would. That should be obvious.\nIt\\'s not a bug\\\nLet me finally mention again a feature I noted in passing:\n  1='first argument'\nsets the first command argument for the current shell or function,\nindependently of any others. People sometimes complain that\n  1000000='millionth argument'\nsuddenly makes the shell use a lot more memory. That\\'s not a bug at\nall: you\\'ve asked the shell to set the millionth element of an array,\nbut not any others, so the shell creates an array a million elements\nlong with the first 999,999 empty, except for any arguments which were\nalready set. It\\'s not surprising this takes up a lot of memory.\n[]{#l51}\n3.3.3: Compiling functions\nSince version 3.1.7, it has been possible to compile functions to their\ninternal format. It doesn\\'t make the functions run any faster, it just\nreduces their loading time; the shell just has to bring the function\ninto memory, then it `runs it as it does any other function. On many\nmodern computers, therefore, you don\\'t gain a great deal from this. I\nhave to admit I don\\'t use it, but there are other definite advantages.\nNote that when I say `compiled\\' I don\\'t mean the way a C compiler,\nsay, would take a file and turn it into the executable code which the\nprocessor understands; here, it\\'s simply the format that the shell\nhappens to use internally --- it\\'s useless without a suitable version\nof zsh to run it. Also, it\\'s no use thinking you can hide your code\nfrom prying eyes this way, like you can to some extent with an ordinary\ncompiler (disassembling anything non-trivial from scratch being a\ntime-consuming job): first of all, ordinary command lines appear inside\nthe compiled files, except in slightly processed form, and secondly\nrunning `functions\\' on a compiled function which has been loaded\nwill show you just as much as it would if the function had been loaded\nnormally.\nOne other advantage is that you can create `digest\\' files, which are\nsets of functions stored in a single file. If you often use a large\nfraction of those files, or they are small, or you like the function\nitself to appear when you run `functions\\' rather than a message saying\nit hasn\\'t been loaded, then this works well. In fact, you can compile\nall the functions in a single directory in one go. You might think this\nuses a lot of memory, but often zsh will simply `memory map\\' the file,\nwhich means rather than reserving extra main memory for it and reading\nit in --- the obvious way of reading files --- it will tell the\noperating system to make the file available as if it were memory, and\nthe system will bring it into memory piece by piece, `paging\\' the file\nas it is needed. This is a very efficient way of doing it. Actually, zsh\nsupports both this method and the obvious method of simply reading in\nthe file (as long as your operating system does); this is described\nlater on.\nA little extra, in case you\\'re interested: if you read in a file\nnormally, the system will usually reserve space on a disk for it, the\n`swap\\', and do paging from there. So in this case you still get the\nsaving of main memory --- this is standard in all modern operating\nsystems. However, it\\'s not as efficient: first of all, you had to\nread the file in in the first place. Secondly it eats up swap space,\nwhich is usually a fixed amount of disk, although if you\\'ve got enough\nmain memory, the system probably won\\'t bother allocating swap. Thirdly\n--- this is probably the clincher for standard zsh functions on a\nlarge system --- if the file is directly mapped read-only, as it is in\nthis case, the system only needs one place in main memory, plus the\nsingle original file on disk, to keep the function, which is very much\nmore efficient. With the other method, you would get multiple copies in\nboth main memory and (where necessary) swap. This is how the system\ntreats directly executable programmes like the shell itself --- the\ndata is specific to each process, but the programme itself can be shared\nbecause it doesn\\'t need to be altered when it\\'s running.\nHere\\'s a simple example.\n  % echo 'echo hello, world' >hw\n  % zcompile hw\n  % ls\n  hw    hw.zwc\n  % rm hw\n  % fpath=(. $fpath)\n  % autoload hw\n  % hw\n  hello, world\nWe created a simple `hello, world\\' function, and compiled it. This\nproduces a file called `hw.zwc\\'. The extension stands for `Z-shell\nWord Code\\', because it\\'s based on the format of words (integers longer\nthan a single byte) used internally by the shell. Then we made sure the\ncurrent directory was in our $fpath, and autoloaded the function,\nwhich ran as expected. We deleted the original file for demonstration\npurposes, but as long as the `.zwc\\' file is newer, that will be\nused, so you don\\'t need to remove the originals in normal use. In fact,\nyou shouldn\\'t, because you will lose any comments and formatting\ninformation in it; you can regenerate the function itself with the\n`functions\\' command (try it here), but the shell only remembers the\ninformation actually needed to run the commands. Note that the function\nwas in the zsh autoload format, not the ksh one, in this case (but see\nbelow).\nAnd there\\'s more\\\nNow some bells and whistles. Remember the KSH_AUTOLOAD thing? When you\ncompile a function, you can specify which format --- native zsh or ksh\nemulation --- will be used for loading it next time, by using the\noption -k or -z, instead of the default, which is to examine the\noption (as would happen if you were autoloading directly from the file).\nThen you don\\'t need to worry about that option. So, for example, you\ncould compile all the standard zsh functions using `zcompile -z\\' and\nsave people the trouble of making sure they are autoloaded correctly.\nYou can also specify that aliases shouldn\\'t be expanded when the files\nare compiled by using -U: this has roughly the same effect as saying\nautoload -U, since when the shell comes to load a compiled file, it\nwill never expand aliases, because the internal format assumes that all\nprocessing of that kind has already been done. The difference in this\ncase is if you don\\'t specify -U: then the aliases found when you\ncompile the file, not when you load the function from it, will be used.\nNow digest files. Here\\'s one convenient way of doing it.\n  % ls ~/tmp/fns\n  hw1   hw2\n  % fpath=(~/tmp/fns $fpath)\n  % cd ~/tmp\n  % zcompile fns fns/*\n  % ls\n  fns   fns.zwc\nWe\\'ve made a directory to put functions in, ~/tmp/fns, and stuck some\nrandom files in it. The zcompile command, this time, was given several\narguments: a filename to use for the compiled functions, and then a list\nof functions to compile into it. The new file, fns.zwc, sits in the\nsame directory where the directory fns, found in $fpath, is. The\nshell will actually search the digest file instead of the directory.\nMore precisely, it will search both, and see which is the more recent,\nand use that as the function. So now\n  % autoload hw1\n  % hw1\n  echo hello, first world\nYou can test what\\'s in the digest file with:\n  % zcompile -t fns\n  zwc file (read) for zsh-3.1.9-dev-3\n  fns/hw1\n  fns/hw2\nNote that the names appear as you gave them on the command line, i.e.\nwith fns/ in front. Only the basenames are important for autoloading\nfunctions. The note `(read)\\' in the first line means that zsh has\nmarked the functions to be read into the shell, rather than memory\nmapped as discussed above; this is easier for small functions,\nparticularly if you are liable to remove or alter a file which is\nmapped, which will confuse the shell. It usually decides which method to\nuse based on size; you can force memory mapping by giving the -M\noption. Memory mapping doesn\\'t work on all systems (currently including\nCygwin).\nI showed this for compiling files, but you can actually tell the shell\nto output compiled functions --- in other words, it will look along\n$fpath and compile the functions you specify. I find compiling files\neasier, when I do it at all, since then I can use patterns to find them\nas I did above. But if you want to do it the other way, you should note\ntwo other options: -a will compile files by looking along $fpath,\nwhile -c will output any functions already loaded by the shell (you\ncan combine the two to use either). The former is recommended, because\nthen you don\\'t lose any information which was present in the autoload\nfile, but not in the function stored in memory ---- this is what\nwould happen if the file defined some extra widgets (in the\nnon-technical sense) which weren\\'t part of the function called\nsubsequently.\nIf you\\'re perfectly happy with the shell only searching a digest\nfile, and not comparing the datestamp with files in the directory, you\ncan put that directly into your $fpath, i.e. ~/tmp/fns.zwc in this\ncase. Then you can get rid of the original directory, or archive it\nsomewhere for reuse.\nYou can compile scripts, too. Since these are in the same format as a\nzsh autoload file, you don\\'t need to do anything different from\ncompiling a single function. You then run (say) script.zwc by typing\n`zsh script\\' --- note that you should omit the .zwc, as zsh\ndecides if there\\'s a compiled version of a script by explicitly\nappending the suffix. What\\'s more, you can run it using `.\\' or\n`source\\' in just the same way (`. script\\') --- this means you\ncan compile your startup files if you find they take too long to run\nthrough; the shell will spot a ~/.zshrc.zwc as it would any other\nsourceable file. It doesn\\'t make much sense to use the memory mapping\nmethod in this case, since once you\\'ve sourced the files you never want\nto run them again, so you might as well specify `zcompile -R\\' to use\nthe reading (non-memory-mapping) method explicitly.\nIf you ever look inside a .zwc file, you will see that the information\nis actually included twice. That\\'s because systems differ about the\norder in which numbers are stored: some have the least significant byte\nfirst (notably Intel and some versions of Mips) and some the most\nsignificant (notably SPARC and Cambridge Consultants\\' XAP processor,\nwhich is notable here mainly because I spend my working hours\nprogramming for it --- you can\\'t run zsh on it). Since zsh uses\nintegers a great deal in the compiled code, it saves them in both\npossible orders for ease of use. Why not just save it for the machine\nwhere you compiled it? Then you wouldn\\'t be able to share the files\nacross a heterogeneous network --- or even worse, if you made a\ndistribution of compiled files, they would work on some machines, and\nnot on others. Think how Emacs users would complain if the .elc files\nthat arrived weren\\'t the right ones. (Worse, think how the vi users\nwould laugh.) The shell never reads or maps in the version it doesn\\'t\nuse, however; only extra disk space is used.\nA little -Xtra help\\\nThere are two final autoloading issues you might want to know about. In\nversions of zsh since 3.1.7, you will see that when you run functions\non a function which is marked for autoload but hasn\\'t yet been loaded,\nyou get:\nafunctionmarkedforautoloadwhichhasntbeenloaded () {\n        # undefined\n        builtin autoload -XU\n}\nThe `# undefined\\' is just printed to alert you that this was a\nfunction marked as autoloadable by the autoload command: you can tell,\nbecause it\\'s the only time functions will emit a comment (though\nthere might be other `#\\' characters around). What\\'s interesting is\nthe autoload command with the -X option. That option means `Mark me\nfor autoloading and run me straight away\\'. You can actually put it in a\nfunction yourself, and it will have the same effect as running\n`autoload\\' on a not-yet-existent function. Obviously, the autoload\ncommand will disappear as soon as you do run it, to be replaced by the\nreal contents. If you put this inside a file to be autoloaded, the shell\nwill complain --- the alternative is rather more unpalatable.\nNote also the -U option was set in that example: that simply means\nthat I used autoload with the -U option when I originally told the\nshell to autoload the function.\nThere\\'s another option, +X, the complete opposite of -X. This one\ncan only be used with autoload outside the function you\\'re loading,\njust as -X was only meaningful inside. It means `load the file\nimmediately, but don\\'t run it\\', so it\\'s a more active (or, as they\nsay nowadays, since they like unnecessarily long words, proactive) form\nof autoload. It\\'s useful if you want to be able to run the\nfunctions command to see the function, but don\\'t want to run the\nfunction itself.\nSpecial functions\\\nI\\'m in danger of simply quoting the manual, but there are various\nfunctions with a special meaning to the shell (apart from TRAP...\nfunctions, which I\\'ve already covered). That is, the functions\nthemselves are perfectly normal, but the shell will run them\nautomatically on certain occasions if they happen to exist, and silently\nskip them if they don\\'t.\nThe two most frequently used are chpwd and precmd. The former is\ncalled whenever the directory changes, either via cd, or pushd, or\nan AUTO_CD --- you could turn the first two into functions, and\navoid needing chpwd but not the last. Here\\'s how to force an xterm,\nor a similar windowing terminal, to put the current directory into the\ntitle bar.\n  chpwd() {\n    [[ -t 1 ]] || return\n    case $TERM in\n      (sun-cmd) print -Pn \"\\e]l%~\\e\\\\\"\n        ;;\n      (*xterm*|rxvt|(dt|k|E)term) print -Pn \"\\e]2;%~\\a\"\n        ;;\n    esac\n  }\nThe first line tests that standard output is really a terminal --- you\ndon\\'t want to print the string in the middle of a script which is\ndirecting its output to a file. Then we look to see if we have a\nsun-cmd terminal, which has its own sui generis sequence for putting\na string into the title bar, or something which recognises xterm escape\nsequences. In either case, the special sequences (a bit like termcap\nsequences as discussed for echotc) are interpreted by the terminal,\nand instead of being printed out cause it to put the string in the\nmiddle into the title bar. The string here is `%~\\': I added the -P\noption to print so it would expand prompt escapes. I could just have\nused $PWD, but this way has the useful effect of shortening your home\ndirectory, or any other named directory, into ~-notation, which is a\nbit more readable. Of course, you can put other stuff there if you like,\nor, if you\\'re really sophisticated, put in a parameter $HEADER and\ndefine that elsewhere.\nIf programmes other than the shell alter what appears in the xterm title\nbar, you might consider changing that chwpd function to precmd. The\nfunction precmd is called just before every prompt; in this case it\nwill restore the title line after every command has run. Some people\nmake the mistake of using it to set up a prompt, but there are enough\nways of getting varying information into a fixed prompt string that you\nshouldn\\'t do that unless you have very odd things in your prompt.\nIt\\'s a big nuisance having to redefine precmd to alter your prompt\n--- especially if you don\\'t know it\\'s there, since then your prompt\napparently magically returns to the same format when you change it.\nThere are some good reasons for using precmd, too, but most of them\nare fairly specialised. For example, on one system I use it to check if\nthere is new input from a programme which is sending data to the shell\nasynchronously, and if so printing it out onto the terminal. This is\npretty much what happens with job control notification if you don\\'t\nhave the NOTIFY option set.\nThe name precmd is a bit of a misnomer: preprompt would have been\nbetter. It usurps the name more logically applied to the function\nactually called preexec, which is run after you finished editing a\ncommand line, but just before the line is executed. preexec has one\nadditional feature: the line about to be executed is passed down as an\nargument. You can\\'t alter what\\'s going to be executed by editing the\nparameter, however: that has been suggested as an upgrade, but it would\nmake it rather easy to get the shell into a state where you can\\'t\nexecute any commands because preexec always messes them up. It\\'s\nbetter, where possible, to write function front-ends to specific\ncommands you want to handle specially. For example, here\\'s my ls\nfunction:\n  local ls\n  if [[ -n $LS_COLORS ]]; then\n    ls=(ls --color=auto)\n  else\n    ls=(ls -F)\n  fi\n  command $ls $*\nThis handles GNU and non-GNU versions of ls. If $LS_COLORS is set, it\nassumes we are using GNU ls, and hence colouring (or colorizing, in\ngeekspeak) is available. Otherwise, it uses the standard option -F to\nshow directories and links with a special symbol. Then it uses command\nto run the real ls --- this is a key thing to remember any time you\nuse a function front-end to a command. I could have done this another\nway: test in my initialisation files which version of ls I was using,\nthen alias ls to one of the two forms. But I didn\\'t.\nApart from the trap functions, there is one remaining special function.\nIt is periodic, which is executed before a prompt, like precmd, but\nonly every now and then, in fact every $PERIOD seconds; it\\'s up to\nyou to set $PERIOD when you defined periodic. If $PERIOD isn\\'t\nset, or is zero, nothing happens. Don\\'t get $PERIOD confused with\n$SECONDS, which just counts up from 0 when the shell starts.\n[]{#l52}\n3.4: Aliases\nAliases are much simpler than functions. In the C shell and its\nderivatives, there are no functions, so aliases take their place and can\nhave arguments, which involve expressions rather like those which\nextract elements of previous history lines with `!\\'. Zsh\\'s aliases,\nlike ksh\\'s, don\\'t take arguments; you have to use functions for that.\nHowever, there are things aliases can do which functions can\\'t, so\nsometimes you end up using both, for example\n  zfget() {\n    # function to retrieve a file by FTP,\n    # using globbing on the remote host\n  }\n  alias zfget='noglob zfget'\nThe function here does the hard work; this is a function from the zftp\nfunction suite, supplied with the shell, which retrieves a file or set\nof files from another machine. The function allows patterns, so you can\nretrieve an entire directory with `zfget *\\'. However, you need to\navoid the `*\\' being expanded into the set of files in the current\ndirectory on the machine you\\'re logged into; this is where the alias\ncomes in, supplying the `noglob\\' in front of the function. There\\'s\nno way of doing this with the function alone; by the time the function\nis called, the `*\\' would already have been expanded. Of course you\ncould quote it, but that\\'s what we\\'re trying to avoid. This is a\ncommon reason for using the alias/function combination.\nRemember to include the `=\\' in alias definition, necessary in zsh,\nunlike csh and friends. If you do:\n  alias zfget noglob zfget\nthey are treated as a list of aliases. Since none has the `=\\' and a\ndefinition, the shell thinks you want to list the definitions of the\nlisted words; I get the output\n  zfget='noglob zfget'\n  zfget='noglob zfget'\nsince zfget was aliased as before, but noglob wasn\\'t aliased and\nwas skipped, although the failed alias lookup caused status 1 to be\nreturned. Remember that the alias command takes as many arguments as\nyou like; any with `=\\' is a definition, any without is a request to\nprint the current definition.\nAliases can in fact be allowed to expand to almost anything the shell\nunderstands, not just sets of words. That\\'s because the text retrieved\nfrom the alias is put back into the input, and reread more or less as if\nyou\\'d typed it. That means you can get away with strange combinations\nlike\n  alias tripe=\"echo foo | sed 's/foo/bar/' |\"\n  tripe cat\nwhich is interpreted exactly the same way as\n  echo foo | sed 's/foo/bar/' | cat\nwhere the word `foo\\' is sent to the stream editor, which alters it\nto `bar\\' (`s/old/new/\\' is sed\\'s syntax for a substitution),\nand passes it on to `cat\\', which simply dumps the output. It\\'s\nuseless, of course, but it does show what can lurk behind an apparently\nsimple command if it happens to be an alias. It is usually not a good\nidea to do this, due to the potential confusion.\nAs the manual entry explains, you can prevent an alias from being\nexpanded by quoting it. This isn\\'t like quoting any other expansion,\nthough; there\\'s no particular important character which has to be\ninterpreted literally to stop the expansion. The point is that because\naliases are expanded early on in processing of the command line, looking\nup an alias is done on a string without quotes removed. So if you have\nan alias `drivel\\', none of the strings `\\drivel\\',\n`'d'rivel\\', or `drivel\"\"\\' will be expanded as the alias: they\nall would have the same effect as proper commands, after the quotes are\nremoved, but as aliases they appear different. The manual entry also\nnotes that you can actually make aliases for any of these special forms,\ne.g. `alias '\\drivel'=...\\' (note the quotes, since you need the\nbackslash to be passed down to the alias command). You would need a\npretty good reason to do so.\nAlthough my `tripe\\' example was silly, you know from the existence\nof `precommand modifiers\\' that it\\'s sometimes useful to have a\nspecial command which precedes a command line, like noglob or the\nnon-shell command nice. Since they have commands following, you would\nprobably expect aliases to be expanded there, too. But this doesn\\'t\nwork:\n  % alias foo='echo an alias for foo'\n  % noglob foo\n  zsh: command not found: foo\nbecause the foo wasn\\'t in command position. The way round this is to\nuse a special feature: aliases whose definitions end in a space force\nthe next word along to be looked up as a possible alias, too:\n  % alias noglob='noglob '\n  % noglob foo\n  an alias for foo\nwhich is useful for any command which can take a command line after it.\nThis also shows another feature of aliases: unlike functions, they\nremember that you have already called an alias of a particular name, and\ndon\\'t look it up again. So the `noglob\\' which comes from expanding\nthe alias is not treated as an alias, but as the ordinary precommand\nmodifier.\nYou may be a little mystified about this difference. A simple answer is\nthat it\\'s useful that way. It\\'s sometimes useful for functions to call\nthemselves; for example if you are handling a directory hierarchy in one\ngo you might get a function to examine a directory, do something for\nevery ordinary file, and for every directory file call itself with the\nnew directory name tacked on. Aliases are too simple for this to be a\nuseful feature. Another answer is that it\\'s particularly easy to mark\naliases as being `in use\\' while they are being expanded, because it\nhappens while the strings inside them are being examined, before any\ncommands are called, where things start to get complicated.\nLastly, there are `global aliases\\'. If aliases can get you into a lot\nof trouble, global aliases can get you into a lot of a lot of trouble.\nThey are defined with the option -g and are expanded not just in\ncommand position, but anywhere on the command line.\n  alias -g L='| less'\n  echo foo L\nThis turns into `echo foo | less\\'. It\\'s a neat trick if you don\\'t\nmind your command lines having only a minimal amount to do with what is\nactually executed.\nI already pointed out that alias lookups are done so early that aliases\nare expanded when you define functions:\n  % alias hello='echo I have been expanded'\n  % fn() {\n  function>  hello\n  function> }\n  % which fn\n  fn () {\n          echo I have been expanded\n  }\nYou can\\'t stop this when typing in functions directly, except by\nquoting part of the name you type. When autoloading, the -U option is\navailable, and recommended for use with any non-trivial function.\nA brief word about that `function>\\' which appears to prompt you\nwhile you are editing a function; I mentioned this in the previous\nchapter but here I want to be clearer about what\\'s going on. While you\nare being prompted like that, the shell is not actually executing the\ncommands you are typing in. Only when it is satisfied that it has a\ncomplete set of commands will it go away and execute them (in this case,\ndefining the function). That means that it won\\'t always spot errors\nuntil right at the end. Luckily, zsh has multi-line editing, so if you\ngot it wrong you should just be able to hit up-arrow and edit what you\ntyped; hitting return will execute the whole thing in one go. If you\nhave redefined $PS2 (or $PROMPT2), or you have an old version of the\nshell, you may not see the full prompt, but you will usually see\nsomething ending in `>\\' which means the same.\n[]{#l53}\n3.5: Command summary\nAs a reminder, the shell looks up commands in this order:\n\naliases, which will immediately be interpreted again as texts for\ncommands, possible even other aliases; they can be deleted with\n`unalias\\',\nreserved words, those special to the shell which often need to be\ninterpreted differently from ordinary commands due to the syntax,\nalthough they can be disabled if you really need to,\nfunctions; these can also be disabled, although it\\'s usually easier\nto `unfunction\\' them,\nbuiltin commands, which can be disabled, or called as a builtin by\nputting `builtin\\' in front,\nexternal commands, which can be called as such, even if the name\nclashes with one of the above types, by putting `command\\' in\nfront.\n\n[]{#l54}\n3.6: Expansions and quotes\nAs I keep advertising, there will be a whole chapter dedicated to the\nsubject of shell expansions and what to do with them. However, it\\'s a\nrather basic subject, which definitely comes under the heading of basic\nshell syntax, so I shall here list all the forms of expansion. As given\nin the manual, there are five stages.\n[]{#l55}\n3.6.1: History expansion\nThis is the earliest, and is only done on an interactive command line,\nand only if you have not set NO_BANG_HIST. It was described in the\nsection `The history mechanism; types of history\\' in the previous\nchapter. It is almost independent of the shell\\'s processing of the\ncommand line; it takes place as the command line is read in, not when\nthe commands are interpreted. However, in zsh it is done late enough\nthat the `!\\'s can be quoted by putting them in single quotes:\n  echo 'Hello!!'\ndoesn\\'t insert the previous line at that point, but\n  echo \"Hello!!\"\ndoes. You can always quote active `!\\'s with a backslash, so\n  echo \"Hello\\!\\!\"\nworks, with or without the double quotes. Amusingly, since single quotes\naren\\'t special in double quotes, if you set the HIST_VERIFY option,\nwhich puts the expanded history line back on the command line for\npossible further editing, and try the first two of the three\npossibilities above in order, then keep hitting return, you will find\never increasing command lines:\n  % echo 'Hello!!'\n  Hello!!\n  % echo \"Hello!!\"\n  % echo \"Helloecho 'Hello!!'\"\n  % echo \"Helloecho 'Helloecho 'Hello!!''\"\n  % echo \"Helloecho 'Helloecho 'Helloecho 'Hello!!'''\"\nand if you understand why, you have a good grasp of how quotes work.\nThere\\'s another way of quoting exclamation marks in a line: put a\n`!\"\\' in it. It can appear anywhere (as long as it\\'s not in single\nquotes) and will be removed from the line, but it has the effect of\ndisabling any subsequent exclamation marks till the end of the line.\nThis is the only time quote marks which are significant to the shell\n(i.e. are not themselves quoted) don\\'t have to occur in a matching\npair.\nNote that as exclamation marks aren\\'t active in any text read\nnon-interactively --- and this includes autoloaded functions and\nsourced files, such as startup files, read inside interactive shells\n--- it is an error to quote any `!\\'s in double quotes in files.\nThis will simply pass on the backslashes to the next level of parsing.\nOther forms of quoting are all right: `\\!\\', because any character\nquoted with a backslash is treated as itself, and '!' because single\nquotes can quote anything anyway.\n[]{#l56}\n3.6.2: Alias expansion\nAs discussed above, alias expansion also goes on as the command line is\nread, so is to a certain extent similar to history expansion. However,\nwhile a history expansion may produce an alias for expansion, `!\\'s\nin the text resulting from alias expansions are normal characters, so it\ncan be thought of as a later phase (and indeed it\\'s implemented that\nway).\n[]{#l57}\n3.6.3: Process, parameter, command, arithmetic and brace expansion\nThere are a whole group of expansions which are done together, just by\nlooking at the line constructed from the input after history and alias\nexpansion and reading it from left to right, picking up any active\nexpansions as the line is examined. Whenever a complete piece of\nexpandable text is found, it is expanded; the text is not re-examined,\nexcept in the case of brace expansion, so none of these types of\nexpansion is performed on any resulting text. Whether later forms of\nexpansion --- in other words, filename generation and filename\nexpansion are performed --- is another matter, depending largely on\nthe GLOB_SUBST option as discussed in the previous chapter. Here\\'s a\nbrief summary of the different types.\nProcess substitution\\\nThere are three forms that result in a command line argument which\nrefers to a file from or to which input or output is taken:\n`(process)\\' runs the process which is expected to generate output\nwhich can be used as input by a command; `>(process)\\' runs the\nprocess which will take input to it; and `=(process)\\' acts like\nthe first one, but it is guaranteed that the file is a plain file.\nThis probably sounds like gobbledygook. Here are some simple examples.\n  cat (There are people in the world with nothing better to do than compile\nlists of dummy uses of the `cat\\' command, as in that example, and\npour scorn on them, but I\\'ll just have to brave it out.) What happens\nis that the command `echo This is output\\' is run, with the obvious\nresult. That output is not put straight into the command line, as it\nwould be with command substitution, to be described shortly. Instead,\nthe command line is given a filename which, when read, gets that output.\nSo it\\'s more like:\n  echo This is output >tmpfile\n  cat (note that the temporary file is cleaned up automatically), except that\nit\\'s more compact. In this example I could have missed out the\nremaining `\\', since cat does the right thing with a filename, but\nI put it there to emphasise the fact that if you want to redirect input\nfrom the process substitution you need an extra `\\', over and\nabove the one in the substitution syntax.\nHere\\'s an example for the corresponding output substitution:\n  echo This is output > \\ \n  >(sed 's/output/rubbish/' >outfile)\nwhich is a perfectly foul example, but works essentially like:\n  echo This is output >tmpfile\n  sed 's/output/rubbish/' outfile\nThere\\'s an obvious relationship to pipes here, and in fact this example\ncould be better written,\n  echo This is output | sed 's/output/rubbish/' >outfile\nA good example of an occasion where the output process substitution\ncan\\'t be replaced by a pipe is when it\\'s on the error output, and\nstandard output is being piped:\n  ./myscript 2> >(grep -v idiot >error.log) |\n      process-output >output.log\na little abstract, but here the main point of the script `myscript\\' is\nto produce some output which undergoes further processing on the\nright-hand side of the pipe. However, we want to process the error\noutput here, by filtering out occurrences of lines which use the word\n`idiot\\', before dumping those errors into a file error.log. So we\nget an effect similar to having two pipelines at once, one for output\nand one for error. Note again the two `>\\' signs present next to\none another to get that effect.\nFinally, the `=(process)\\' form. Why do we need this as well as the\none with `\\'? To understand that, you need to know a little of how\nzsh tries to implement the latter type efficiently. Most modern\nUNIX-like systems have `named pipes\\', which are essentially files that\nbehave like the `|\\' on the command line: one process writes to the\nfile, another reads from it, and the effect is essentially that data\ngoes straight through. If your system has them, you will usually find\nthe following demonstration works:\n  % mknod tmpfile p\n  % echo This is output >tmpfile &\n  [2] 1507\n  % read line > tmpfile\n  % print -- $line\n  This is output\n  %\nThe syntax to create a named pipe is that rather strange `mknod\\'\ncommand, with `p\\' for pipe. We stick this in the background, because\nit won\\'t do anything yet: you can\\'t write to the pipe when there\\'s\nno-one to read it (a fundamental rule of pipes which isn\\'t quite as\nobvious as it may seem, since it is possible for data to lurk in the\npipe, buffered, before the process reading from it extracts it), so we\nput that in the background to wait for action. This comes in the next\nline, where we read from the pipe: that allows the echo to complete\nand exit. Then we print out the line we\\'ve read.\nThe problem with pipes is that they are just temporary storage spaces\nfor data on the way through. In particular, you can\\'t go back to the\nbeginning (in C-speak, `you can\\'t seek backwards on a pipe\\') and\nre-read what was there. Sometimes this doesn\\'t matter, but some\ncommands, such as editors, need that facility. As the `\\' process\nsubstitution is implemented with named pipes (well, maybe), there is\nalso the `=\\' form, which produces a real, live temporary file,\nprobably in the `/tmp\\' directory, containing the output from the\nfile, and then puts the name of that file on the command line. The\nmanual notes, unusually helpfully, that this is useful with the\n`diff\\' command for comparing the output of two processes:\n  diff =(./myscript1) =(./myscript2)\nwhere, presumably, the two scripts produce similar, but not identical,\noutput which you want to compare.\nI said `well, maybe\\' in that paragraph because there\\'s another way\nzsh can do `\\' process substitutions. Many modern systems allow you\nto access a file with a name like `/dev/fd/0\\' which corresponds to\nfile descriptor 0, in this case standard input: to anticipate the\nsection on redirection, a `file descriptor\\' is a number assigned to a\nparticular input or output stream. This method allows you to access it\nas a file; and if this facility is available, zsh will use it to pass\nthe name of the file in process substitution instead of using a named\npipe, since in this case it doesn\\'t have to create a temporary file;\nthe system does everything. Now, if you are really on the ball, you will\nrealise that this doesn\\'t get around the problem of pipes --- where\nis data on this file descriptor going to come from? The answer is that\nit will either have to come from a real temporary file --- which is\npointless, because that\\'s what we wanted to avoid --- or from a pipe\nopened from some process --- which is equivalent to the named pipe\nmethod, except with just a file descriptor instead of a name. So even if\nzsh does it this way, you still need the `=\\' form for programmes\nwhich need to go backwards in what they\\'re reading.\nParameter substitution\\\nYou\\'ve seen enough of this already. This comes from a `$\\' followed\neither by something in braces, or by alphanumeric characters forming the\nname of the parameter: `$foo\\' or `${foo}\\', where the second form\nprotects the expansion from any other strings at the ends and also\nallows a veritable host of extra things to appear inside the braces to\nmodify the substitution. More detail will be held over to till chapter\n5; there\\'s a lot of it.\nCommand substitution\\\nThis has two forms, $(process) and ` process` . They\nfunction identically; the first form has two advantages: substitutions\ncan be nested, since the end character is different from the start\ncharacter, and (because it uses a `$\\') it reminds you that, like\nparameter substitutions, command substitutions can take place inside\ndouble-quoted strings. In that case, like most other things in quotes,\nthe result will be a single word; otherwise, the result is split into\nwords on any field separators you have defined, usually whitespace or\nthe null character. I\\'ll use the args function again:\n  % args() { print $# $*; }\n  % args $(echo two words)\n  2 two words\n  % args \"$(echo one word)\"\n  1 one word\nThe first form will split on newlines, not just spaces, so an equivalent\nis\n  % args $(echo two; echo words)\n  2 two words\nThus entire screens of text will be flattened out into a single line of\nsingle-word command arguments. By contrast, with the double quotes no\nprocessing is done whatsoever; the entire output is put verbatim into\none command argument, with newlines intact. This means that the quite\ncommon case of wanting a single complete line from a file per command\nargument has to be handled by trickery; zsh has such trickery, but\nthat\\'s the stuff of chapter 5.\nNote the difference from process substitution: no intermediate file name\nis involved, the output itself goes straight onto the command line. This\nform of substitution is considerably more common, and, unlike the other,\nis available in all UNIX shells, though not in all shells with the more\nmodern form `$(...)\\'.\nThe rule that the command line is evaluated only once, left to right, is\nadhered to here, but it\\'s a little more complicated in this case since\nthe expression being substituted is scanned as a complete command\nline, so can include anything a command usually can, with all the rules\nof quoting and expansion being applied. So if you get confused about\nwhat a command substitution is actually up to, you should extract the\ncommands from it and think of them as a command line in their own right.\nWhen you\\'ve worked out what that\\'s doing, decide what it\\'s output\nwill be, and that\\'s the result of the substitution. You can ignore any\nerror output; that isn\\'t captured, so will go straight to the terminal.\nIf you want to ignore it, use the standard trick (see below)\n`2>/dev/null\\' inside the command substitution --- not on the\nmain command line, where it won\\'t work because substitutions are\nperformed before redirection of the main command line, and in any case\nthat will have the obvious side effect of changing the error output from\nthe command line itself.\nThe only real catch with command substitution is that, as it is run as a\nseparate process --- even if it only involves shell builtins --- no\neffects other than the output will percolate back to the main shell:\n  % print $(bar=value; print bar is $bar)\n  bar is value\n  % print bar is $bar\n  bar is\nThere is maybe room for a form of substitution that runs inside the\nshell, instead; however, with modern computers the overhead in starting\nthe extra process is pretty small --- and in any case we seem to have\nrun out of new forms of syntax.\nOnce you know and are comfortable with command substitution, you will\nprobably start using it all the time, so there is one good habit to get\ninto straight away. A particularly common use is simply to put the\ncontents of a file onto the command line.\n  # Don't do this, do the other.\n  process_cmd `cat file_arguments`\nBut there\\'s a shortcut.\n  # Do do this, don't do the other\n  process_cmd $(It\\'s not only less writing, it\\'s more efficient: zsh spots the special\nsyntax, with the  immediately inside the parentheses, reads the file\ndirectly without bothering to start `cat\\', and inserts its contents:\nno external process is involved. You shouldn\\'t confuse this with `null\nredirections\\' as described below: the syntax is awfully similar,\nunfortunately, but the feature shown here is not dependent on that other\nfeature being enabled or set up in a particular way. In fact, this\nfeature works in ksh, which doesn\\'t have zsh\\'s null redirections.\nYou can quote the file-reading form too, of course: in that case, the\ncontents of the file `cmd_arguments\\' would be passed as just one\nargument, with newlines and spaces intact.\nSometimes, the rule about splitting the result of a command substitution\ncan get you into trouble:\n  % typeset foo=`echo words words`\n  % print $foo\n  words\nYou probably expected the command substitution not to be split here.\nbut it was, and the shell executed typeset with the arguments\n`foo=words\\' and `words\\'. That\\'s because in zsh arguments to\ntypeset are treated pretty much normally, except for some jiggery\npokery with tildes described below. Other shells do this differently,\nand zsh (from 4.0.2 and 4.1.1) provides a compatibility option,\nKSH_TYPESET. In earlier versions you need to use quotes:\n  % typeset foo=\"`echo words words`\"\n  % print $foo\n  words words\nA really rather technical afterword: using `$(cat file_arguments)\\',\nyou might have counted two extra processes to be started, one being the\nusual one for a command substitution, and another the `cat\\' process,\nsince that\\'s an external command itself. That would indeed be the\nobvious way of doing it, but in fact zsh has an optimisation in cases\nlike this: if it knows the shell is about to exit --- in this case,\nthe forked process which is just interpreting the command line for the\nsubstitution --- it will not bother to start a new process for the\nlast command, and here just replaces itself with the cat. So actually\nthere\\'s only one extra process here. Obviously, an interactive shell is\nnever replaced in this way, since clairvoyance is not yet a feature of\nthe shell.\nArithmetic substitution\\\nArithmetic substitution is easy to explain: everything I told you about\nthe (( ... )) command under numerical parameters, above, applies to\narithmetic substitution. You simply bang a `$\\' in front, and it\nbecomes an expansion.\n  % print $(( 32 + 2 * 5 ))\n  42\nYou can perform everything inside arithmetic substitution that you can\ninside the builtin, including assignments; the only difference is that\nthe status is not set, instead the value is put directly onto the\ncommand line in place of the original expression. As in C, the value of\nan assignment is the value being assigned, `$(( param = 3 + 2))\\'\nsubstitutes the value 5 as well as assigning it to $param.\nBy the way, there\\'s an extra level of substitution involved in all\narithmetic expansions, since scalar parameters are subject to arithmetic\nexpansion when they\\'re read in. This is simple if they only contain\nnumbers, but less obvious if they contain complete expressions:\n  % foo=3+5\n  % print $(( foo + 2))\n  10\nThe foo was evaluated into 8 before it was substituted in. Note this\nmeans there were two evaluations: this doesn\\'t work:\n  % foo=3+\n  % print $(( foo 2 ))\n  zsh: bad math expression: operand expected at `'\n--- the complaint here is about the missing operand after the `+\\'\nin the $foo. However the following does work:\n  % foo=3+\n  % print $(( $foo 2 ))\n  5\nThat\\'s because the scalar $foo is turned into 3+ first. This is\nmore logical than you might think: with the rule about left to right\nevaluation, the $foo is picked up inside the $((...)) and expanded\nas an ordinary parameter substitution while the argument of $((...))\nis being scanned. Then the complete argument `3+ 2\\' is expanded as\nan arithmetical expression. (Unfortunately, zsh isn\\'t always this\nlogical; there could easily be cases where we haven\\'t thought it\nthrough --- you should feel free to bring these to our attention.)\nThere\\'s an older form with single square brackets instead of double\nparentheses; there is now no reason to use it, as it\\'s non-standard,\nbut you may sometimes still meet it.\nBrace expansion\\\nBrace expansion is a feature acquired from the C shell and it\\'s\nrelatives, although some versions of ksh have it, as it\\'s a compile\ntime option there. It\\'s a useful way of saving you from typing the same\nthing twice on a single command line:\n  % print -l {foo,bar}' is used far too often in examples'\n  foo is used far too often in examples\n  bar is used far too often in examples\n`print\\' is given two arguments which it is told to print out one per\nline. The text in quotes is common to both, but one has `foo\\' in\nfront, while the other has `bar\\' in front. The brace expression can\nequally be in the middle of an argument: for example, a common use of\nthis among programmers is for similarly named source files:\n  % print zle_{tricky,vi,word}.c\n  zle_tricky.c zle_vi.c zle_word.c\nAs you see, you\\'re not limited to two; you can have any number. You can\nquote a comma if you need a real one:\n  % print -l \\`{\\,,.}\\'' is a punctuation character'\n  `,' is a punctuation character\n  `.' is a punctuation character\nThe quotes needed quoting with a backslash to get them into the output.\nThe second comma is the active one for the braces.\nYou can nest braces. Once again, this is done left to right. In\n  print {now,th{en,ere{,abouts}}}\nthe first argument of the outer brace is `now\\', and the second is\n`th{en,ere{,abouts}}\\'. This brace expands to `then\\' and then the\nexpansion of `there{,abouts}\\', which is `there thereabouts\\'\n--- there\\'s nothing to stop you having an empty argument. Putting\nthis all together, we have\n  print now then there thereabouts\nThere\\'s more to know about brace expansion, which will appear in\nchapter 5 on clever expansions.\n[]{#l58}\n3.6.4: Filename Expansion\nIt\\'s a shame the names `filename expansion\\' and `filename\ngeneration\\' sound so similar, but most people just refer to `~ and\n= expansion\\' and `globbing\\' respectively, which is all that is\nmeant by the two. The first is by far the simpler. The rule is: unquoted\n`~\\'s at the beginning of words perform expansion of named\ndirectories, which may be your home directory:\n  % print ~\n  /home/pws\nsome user\\'s home directory:\n  % print ~root\n  /root\n(that may turn up `/\\' on your system), a directory named directly by\nyou:\n  % t=/tmp\n  % print ~t\n  /tmp\na directory you\\'ve recently visited:\n  % pwd\n  /home/pws/zsh/projects/zshguide\n  % print ~+\n  /home/pws/zsh/projects/zshguide\n  % cd /tmp\n  % print ~-\n  /home/pws/zsh/projects/zshguide\nor a directory in your directory stack:\n  % pushd /tmp\n  % pushd ~\n  % pushd /var/tmp\n  % print ~2\n  /tmp\nThese forms were discussed above. There are various extra rules. You can\nadd a `/\\' after any of them, and the expansions still take place, so\nyou can use them to specify just the first part of a longer expression\n(as you almost certainly have done with a simple `~\\'). If you quote\nthe `~\\' in any of the ways quoting normally takes place, the\nexpansion doesn\\'t happen.\nA ~ in the middle of the word means something completely different, if\nyou have the EXTENDED_GLOB option set; if you don\\'t, it doesn\\'t mean\nanything. There are a few exceptions here; assignments are a fairly\nnatural one:\n  % foo=~pws\n  % print $foo\n  /home/pws\n(note that the `~pws\\', being unquoted, was expanded straight away at\nthe assignment, not at the print statement). But the following works\ntoo:\n  % PATH=$PATH:~pws/bin\nbecause colons are special in assignments. Note that this happens even\nif the variable isn\\'t a colon-separated path; the shell doesn\\'t know\nwhat use you\\'re going to make of all the different variables.\nThe companion of `~\\' is `=\\', which again has to occur at the\nstart of a word or assignment to be special. The remainder of the word\n(here the entire remainder, because directory paths aren\\'t useful) is\ntaken as the name of an external command, and the word is expanded to\nthe complete path to that command, using $PATH just as if the command\nwere to be executed:\n  % print =ls\n  /bin/ls\nand, slightly confusingly,\n  % foo==ls\n  % print $foo\n  /bin/ls\nwhere the two `=\\'s have two different meanings. This form is useful\nin a number of cases. For example, you might want to look at or edit a\nscript which you know is in your path; the form\n  % vi =scriptname\nis more convenient than the more traditional\n  % vi `whence -p ls`\nwhere I put the `-p\\' in to force whence to follow the path,\nignoring builtins, functions, etc. This brings us to another use for\n`=\\' expansion,\n  % =ls\nis a neat and extremely short way of referring to an external command\nwhen ls is usually a function. It has some of the same effect as\n`command ls\\', but is easier to type.\nIn versions up to and including 4.0, this syntax will also expand\naliases, so you need to be a bit careful if you really want a path to an\nexternal command:\n  % alias foo='ls -F'\n  % print =foo\n  ls -F\n(Path expansion is done in preference, so you are safe if you use ls,\nunless your $PATH is strange.) Putting `=foo\\' at the start of the\ncommand line doesn\\'t work, and the reason why bears examination:\n=-expansion occurs quite late on, after ordinary alias expansion and\nword splitting, so that the result is the single word `ls -F\\', where\nthe space is part of the word, which probably doesn\\'t mean anything\n(and if it does, don\\'t lend me your computer when I need something done\nin a hurry). It\\'s probably already obvious that alias expansion here is\nmore trouble than it\\'s worth. A less-than-exhaustive search failed to\nfind anyone who liked this feature, and it has been removed from the\nshell from 4.1, so that `=\\'-expansion now only expands paths to\nexternal commands.\nIf you don\\'t like =-expansion, you can turn it off by setting the\noption NO_EQUALS. One catch, which might make you want to do that, is\nthat the commands mmv, mcp and mln, which are a commonly used\nthough non-standard piece of free software, use `=\\' followed by a\nnumber to replace a pattern, for example\n  mmv '*.c' '=1.old.c'\nrenames all files ending with .c to end with .old.c. If you were not\nalert, you might forget to quote the second word. Otherwise, however,\n=\\' isn\\'t very common at the start of a word, so you\\'re probably\nfairly safe. For a way to do that with zsh patterns, see the discussion\nof the function zmv below (the answer is\n`zmv '(*).c' '$1.old.c'\\').\nNote that zsh is smart enough to complete the names of commands after an\n`=\\' of the expandable sort when you hit TAB.\n[]{#l59}\n3.6.5: Filename Generation\nFilename generation is exactly the same as `globbing\\': the expanding\nof any unquoted wildcards to match files. This is only done in one\ndirectory at a time. So for example\n  print *.c\nwon\\'t match files in a subdirectory ending in `.c\\'. However, it\nis done on all parts of a path, so\n  print */*.c\nwill match all `.c\\' files in all immediate subdirectories of the\ncurrent directory. Furthermore, zsh has an extension --- one of its\nmost commonly used special features --- to match files in any\nsubdirectory at any depth, including the current directory: use two\n`*\\'s as part of the path:\n  print **/*.c\nwill match `prog.c\\', `version1/prog.c\\',\n`version2/test/prog.c\\', `oldversion/working/saved/prog.c\\', and\nso on. I will talk about filename generation and other uses of zsh\\'s\nextremely powerful patterns at much greater length in chapter\n5. My main thrust here is to fit it into other\nforms of expansion; the main thing to remember is that it comes last,\nafter everything has already been done.\nSo although you would certainly expect this to work,\n  print ~/*\ngenerating all files in your home directory, you now know why: it is\nfirst expanded to `/home/pws/*\\' (or wherever), then the shell scans\ndown the path until it finds a pattern, and looks in the directory it\nhas reached (/home/pws) for matching files. Furthermore,\n  foo=~/\n  print $foo*\nworks. However, as I explained in the last chapter, you need to be\ncareful with\n  foo=*\n  print ~/$foo\nThis just prints `/home/pws/*\\'. To get the `*\\' from the\nparameter to be a wildcard, you need to tell the shell explicitly\nthat\\'s what you want:\n  foo=*\n  print ~/${~foo}\nAs also noted, other shells do expand the * as a wildcard anyway. The\nzsh attitude here, as with word splitting, is that parameters should do\nexactly what they\\'re told rather than waltz off generating extra words\nor expansions.\nBe even more careful with arrays:\n  foo=(*)\nwill expand the * immediately, in the current directory --- the\nelements of the array assignment are expanded exactly like a normal\ncommand line glob. This is often very useful, but note the difference\nfrom scalar assignments, which do other forms of expansion, but not\nglobbing.\nI\\'ll mention a few possible traps for the unwary, which might confuse\nyou until you are a zsh globbing guru. Firstly, parentheses actually\nhave two uses. Consider:\n  print (foo|bar)(.)\nThe first set of parentheses means `match either foo or bar\\'. If\nyou\\'ve used egrep, you will probably be familiar with this. The\nsecond, however, simply means `match only regular files\\'. The\n`(.)\\' is called a `globbing qualifier\\', because it limits the\nscope of any matches so far found. For example, if either or both of\nfoo and bar were found, but were directories, they would not now be\nmatched. There are many other possibilities for globbing qualifiers. For\nnow, the easiest way to tell if something at the end is not a globbing\nqualifier is if it contains a `|\\'.\nThe second point is about forms like this:\n  print file-.dat\nThe `\\' and `>\\' smell of redirection, as described next, but\nactually the form `\\', optional start number, `-\\', optional\nfinish number, `>\\' means match any positive integer in the range\nbetween the two numbers, inclusive; if either is omitted, there is no\nlimit on that end, hence the cryptic but common `\\' to match any\npositive integer --- in other words, any group of decimal digits\n(bases other than ten are not handled by this notation). Older versions\nof the shell allowed the form `<>\\' as a shorthand to match any\nnumber, but the overlap with redirection was too great, as you\\'ll see,\nso this doesn\\'t work any more.\nAnother two cryptic symbols are the two that do negation. These only\nwork with the option `EXTENDED_GLOB\\' set: this is necessary to get\nthe most out of zsh\\'s patterns, but it can be a trap for the unwary by\nturning otherwise innocuous characters into patterns:\n  print ^foo\nThis means any file in the current directory except the file foo.\nOne way of coming unstuck with `^\\' is something like\n  stty kill ^u\nwhere you would hope `^u\\' means control with `u\\', i.e. ASCII\ncharacter 21. But it doesn\\'t, if EXTENDED_GLOB is set: it means `any\nfile in the current directory except one called `u\\' \\', which is\ndefinitely a different thing. The other negation operator isn\\'t usually\nso fraught, but it can look confusing:\n  print *.c~f*\nis a pattern of two halves; the shell tries to match `*.c\\', but\nrejects any matches which also match `f*\\'. Luckily, a `~\\' right\nat the end isn\\'t special, so\n rm *.c~\nremoves all files ending in `.c~\\' --- it wouldn\\'t be very nice if\nit matched all files ending in `.c\\' and treated the final `~\\' as\nan instruction not to reject any, so it doesn\\'t. The most likely case I\ncan think of where you might have problems is with Emacs\\' numeric\nbackup files, which can have a `~\\' in the middle which you should\nquote. There is no confusion with the directory use of `~\\', however:\nthat only occurs at the beginning of a word, and this use only occurs in\nthe middle.\nThe final oddments that don\\'t fit into normal shell globbing are forms\nwith `#\\'. These also require that EXTENDED_GLOB be set. In the\nsimplest use, a `#\\' after a pattern says `match this zero or more\ntimes\\'. So `(foo|bar)#.c\\' matches foo.c, bar.c, foofoo.c,\nbarbar.c, foobarfoo.c, ... With an extra #, the pattern before\n(or single character, if it has no special meaning) must match at least\nonce. The other use of `#\\' is in a facility called `globbing\nflags\\', which look like `(#X)\\' where `X\\' is some letter,\npossibly followed by digits. These turn on special features from that\npoint in the pattern and are one of the newest features of zsh patterns;\nthey will receive much more space in chapter 5.\n[]{#l60}\n3.7: Redirection: greater-thans and less-thans\nRedirection means retrieving input from some other file than the usual\none, or sending output to some other file than the usual one. The\nsimplest examples of these are `\\' and `>\\', respectively.\n  % echo 'This is an announcement' >tempfile\n  % cat newfile\n  % cat newfile\n  This is an announcement\nHere, echo sends its output to the file tempfile; cat took its\ninput from that file and sent its output --- the same as its input\n--- to the file newfile; the second cat takes its input from\nnewfile and, since its output wasn\\'t redirected, it appeared on the\nterminal.\nThe other basic form of redirection is a pipe, using `|\\'. Some\npeople loosely refer to all redirections as pipes, but that\\'s rather\nconfusing. The input and output of a pipe are both programmes, unlike\nthe case above where one end was a file. You\\'ve seen lots of examples\nalready:\n  echo foo | sed 's/foo/bar/'\nHere, echo sends its output to the programme sed, which substitutes\nfoo by bar, and sends its own output to standard output. You can chain\ntogether as many pipes as you like; once you\\'ve grasped the basic\nbehaviour of a single pipe, it should be obvious how that works:\n  echo foo is a word | \n    sed 's/foo/bar/' | \n    sed 's/a word/an unword/'\nruns another sed on the output of the first one. (You can actually\ntype it like that, by the way; the shell knows a pipe symbol can\\'t be\nat the end of a command.) In fact, a single sed will suffice:\n  echo foo is a word |\n    sed -e 's/foo/bar/' -e 's/a word/an unword/'\nhas the same effect in this case.\nObviously, all three forms of redirection only work if the programme in\nquestion expects input from standard input, and sends output to standard\noutput. You can\\'t do:\n  echo 'edit me' | vi\nto edit input, since vi doesn\\'t use the input sent to it; it always\ndeals with files. Most simple UNIX commands can be made to deal with\nstandard input and output, however. This is a big difference from other\noperating systems, where getting programmes to talk to each other in an\nautomated fashion can be a major headache.\n[]{#l61}\n3.7.1: Clobber\nThe word `clobber\\', as in the option NO_CLOBBER which I mentioned in\nthe previous chapter, may be unfamiliar to people who don\\'t use English\nas their first language. Its basic meaning is `hit\\' or `defeat\\' or\n`destroy\\', as in `Itchy and Scratchy clobbered each other with\nmallets\\'. If you do:\n  % echo first go >file\n  % echo second go >file\nthen file will contain only the words `second go\\'. The first thing\nyou put into the file, `first go\\', has been clobbered. Hence the\nNO_CLOBBER option: if this is set, the shell will complain when you\ntry to overwrite the file. You can use `>|file\\' or `>! file\\' to\noverride this. You usually can\\'t use `>!file\\' because history\nexpansion will try to expand `!file\\' before the shell parses the\nline; hence the form with the vertical bar tends to be more useful.\n[]{#l62}\n3.7.2: File descriptors\nUNIX-like systems refer to different channels such as input, output and\nerror by `file descriptors\\', which are small integers. Usually three\nare special: 0, standard input; 1, standard output; and 2, standard\nerror. Bourne-like shells (but not csh-like shells) allow you to refer\nto a particular file descriptor, instead of standard input or output, by\nputting the integer immediately before the `\\' or `>\\' (no space\nis allowed). What\\'s more, if the `\\' or `>\\' is followed\nimmediately by `&\\', a file descriptor can follow the redirection\n(the one before is optional as usual). A common use is:\n  % echo This message will go to standard error >&2\nThe command sends its message to standard output, file descriptor 1. As\nusual, `>\\' redirects standard output. This time, however, it is\nredirected not to a file, but to file descriptor 2, which is standard\nerror. Normally this is the same device as standard output, but it can\nbe redirected completely separately. So:\n  % { echo A message\n  cursh> echo An error >&2 } >file\n  An error\n  % cat file\n  A message\nApologies for the slightly unclear use of the continuation prompt\n`cursh>\\': this guide goes into a lot of different formats, and some\nare a bit finicky about long lines in preformatted text. As pointed out\nabove, the `>file\\' here will redirect all output from the stuff in\nbraces, just as if it were a single command. However, the `>&2\\'\ninside redirects the output of the second echo to standard error.\nSince this wasn\\'t redirected, it goes straight to the terminal.\nNote the form in braces in the previous example --- I\\'m going to use\nthat in a few more examples. It simply sends something to standard\noutput, and something else to standard error; that\\'s its only use.\nApart from that, you can treat the bit in braces as a black box ---\nanything which can produce both sorts of output.\nSometimes you want to redirect both at once. The standard Bourne-like\nway of doing this is:\n  % { echo A message\n  cursh> echo An error >&2 } >file 2>&1\nThe `>file\\' redirects standard output from the {...} to the\nfile; the following 2>&1 redirects standard error to wherever standard\noutput happens to be at that point, which is the same file. This allows\nyou to copy two file descriptors to the same place. Note that the order\nis important; if you swapped the two around, `2>&1\\' would copy\nstandard error to the initial destination of standard output, which is\nthe terminal, before it got around to redirecting standard output.\nZsh has a shorthand for this borrowed from csh-like shells:\n  % { echo A message\n  cursh> echo An error >&2 } >&file\nis exactly equivalent to the form in the previous paragraph, copying\nstandard output and standard error to the same file. There is obviously\na clash of syntax with the descriptor-copying mechanism, but if you\ndon\\'t have files whose names are numbers you won\\'t run into it. Note\nthat csh-like shells don\\'t have the descriptor-copying mechanism: the\nsimple `>&\\' and the same thing with pipes are the only uses of\n`&\\' for redirections, and it\\'s not possible there to refer to\nparticular file descriptors.\nTo copy standard error to a pipe, there are also two forms:\n  % { echo A message\n  cursh> echo An error >&2 } 2>&1 | sed -e 's/A/I/'\n  I message\n  In error\n  % { echo A message\n  cursh> echo An error >&2 } |& sed -e 's/A/I/'\n  I message\n  In error\nIn the first case, note that the pipe is opened before the other\nredirection, so that `2>&1\\' copies standard error to the pipe, not\nthe original standard output; you couldn\\'t put that after the pipe in\nany case, since it would refer to the `sed\\' command\\'s output. The\nsecond way is like csh; unfortunately, `|&\\' has a different meaning\nin ksh (start a coprocess), so zsh is incompatible with ksh in this\nrespect.\nYou can also close a file descriptor you don\\'t need: the form\n`2\\' will close standard error for the command where it appears.\nOne thing not always appreciated about redirections is that they can\noccur anywhere on the command line, not just at the end.\n  % >file echo foo\n  % cat file\n  foo\n[]{#l63}\n3.7.3: Appending, here documents, here strings, read write\nThere are various other forms which use multiple `>\\'s and `\\'s.\nFirst,\n  % echo foo >file\n  % echo bar >>file\n  % cat file\n  foo\n  bar\nThe `>``>\\' appends to the file instead of overwriting it. Note,\nhowever, that if you use this a lot you may find there are neater ways\nof doing the same thing. In this example,\n  % { echo foo\n  cursh> echo bar } >file\n  % cat file\n  foo\n  bar\nHere, `cursh>\\' is a prompt from the shell that it is waiting for you\nto close the `{\\' construct which executes a set of commands in the\ncurrent shell. This construct can have a redirection applied to the\nentire sequence of commands: `>file\\' after the closing brace\ntherefore redirects the output from both echos.\nIn the case of input, doubling the sign has a totally different effect.\nThe word after the  is not a file, but a string which will be used\nto mark in the end of input. Input is read until a line with only this\nstring is found:\n  % sed -e 's/foo/bar/'  This line has foo in it.\n  heredoc> There is another foo in this one.\n  heredoc> HERE\n  This line has a bar in it.\n  There is another bar in this one.\nThe shell prompts you with `heredoc>\\' to tell you it is reading a\n`here document\\', which is how this feature is referred to. When it\nfinds the final string, in this case `HERE\\', it passes everything\nyou have typed as input to the command as if it came from a file. The\ncommand in this case is the stream editor, which has been told to\nreplace the first `foo\\' on each line with a `bar\\'. (Replacing\nthings with a bar is a familiar experience from the city centre of my\nhome town, Newcastle upon Tyne.)\nSo far, the features are standard in Bourne-like shells, but zsh has an\nextension to here documents, sometimes referred to as `here strings\\'.\n  % sed -e 's/string/nonsense/' \\ \n  > Note that `>\\' on the second line is a continuation prompt, not part\nof the command line; it was just too long for the TeX version of this\ndocument if I didn\\'t split it. This is a shorthand form of `here\\'\ndocument if you just want to pass a single string to standard input.\nThe final form uses both symbols: `<>file\\' opens the file for\nreading and writing --- but only on standard input. In other words, a\nprogramme can now both read from and write to standard input. This\nisn\\'t used all that often, and when you do use it you should remember\nthat you need to open standard output explicitly to the same file:\n  % echo test >/tmp/redirtest\n  % sed 's/e/Z/g' <>/tmp/redirtest 1>&0\n  % cat /tmp/redirtest\n  tZtst\nAs standard input (the 0) was opened for writing, you can perform the\nunusual trick of copying standard output (the 1) into it. This is\ngenerally not a particularly safe way of doing in-place editing,\nhowever, though it seems to work fine with sed. Note that in older\nversions of zsh, `<>\\' was equivalent to `\\', which is a\npattern that matches any number; this was changed quite some time ago.\n[]{#l64}\n3.7.4: Clever tricks: exec and other file descriptors\nAll Bourne-like shells have two other features. First, the `command\\'\nexec, which I described above as being used to replace the shell with\nthe command you give after it, can be used with only redirections after\nit. These redirections then apply permanently to the shell itself,\nrather than temporarily to a single command. So\n  exec >file\nmakes file the destination for standard output from that point on.\nThis is most useful in scripts, where it\\'s quite common to want to\nchange the destination of all output.\nThe second feature is that you can use file descriptors which haven\\'t\neven been opened yet, as long as they are single digits --- in other\nwords, you can use numbers 3 to 9 for your own purposes. This can be\ncombined with the previous feature for some quite clever effects:\n  exec 3>&1               \n  # 3 refers to stdout\n  exec >file\n  # stdout goes to `file', 3 untouched\n      # random commands output to `file'\n  exec 1>&3               \n  # stdout is now back where it was\n  exec 3>&-\n  # file descriptor 3 closed to tidy up\nHere, file descriptor 3 has been used simply as a placeholder to\nremember where standard output was while we temporarily divert it. This\nis an alternative to the `{...} >file\\' trick. Note that you can\nput more than one redirection on the exec line: `exec 3>&1 >file\\'\nalso works, as long as you keep the order the same.\n[]{#l65}\n3.7.5: Multios\nMultios allow you to do an implicit `cat\\' (concatenate files) on\ninput and `tee\\' (send the same data to different files) on output.\nThey depend on the option MULTIOS being set, which it is by default. I\ndescribed this in the last chapter in discussing whether or not you\nshould have the option set, so you can look at the examples there.\nHere\\'s one fact I didn\\'t mention. You use output multios like this:\n  command-generating-output >file1 >file2\nwhere the command\\'s output is copied to both files. This is done by a\nprocess forked off by the shell: it simply sits waiting for input, then\ncopies it to all the files in its list. There\\'s a problem in all\nversions of the shell to date (currently 4.0.6): this process is\nasynchronous, so you can\\'t rely on it having finished when the shell\nstarts executing the next command. In other words, if you look at\nfile1 or file2 immediately after the command has finished, they may\nnot yet contain all the output because the forked process hasn\\'t\nfinished writing to it.\nThis is really a bug, but for the time being you will have to live with\nit as it\\'s quite complicated to fix in all cases. Multios are most\nuseful as a shorthand in interactive use, like so much of zsh; in a\nscript or function it is safer to use tee,\n  command-generating-output | tee file1 file2\nwhich does the same thing, but as tee is handled as a synchronous\nprocess file1 and file2 are guaranteed to be complete when the\npipeline exits.\n[]{#l66}\n3.8: Shell syntax: loops, (sub)shells and so on\n[]{#l67}\n3.8.1: Logical command connectors\nI have been rather cavalier in using a couple of elements of syntax\nwithout explaining them:\n  true  &&  print Previous command returned true\n  false  ||  print Previous command returned false\nThe relationship between `&&\\' and `||\\' and tests is fairly\nobvious, but in this case they connect complete commands, not test\narguments. The `&&\\' executes the following command if the one before\nsucceeded, and the `||\\' executes the following command if the one\nbefore failed. In other words, the first is equivalent to\n  if true; then\n    print Previous command returned true\n  fi\nbut is more compact.\nThere is a perennial argument about whether to use these or not. In the\ncomp.unix.shell newsgroup on Usenet, you see people arguing that the\n`&&\\' syntax is unreadable, and only an idiot would use it, while\nother people argue that the full `if\\' syntax is slower and clumsier,\nand only an idiot would use that for a simple test; but Usenet is like\nthat, and both answers are a bit simplistic. On the one hand, the\ndifference in speed between the two forms is minute, probably measurable\nin microseconds rather than milliseconds on a modern computer; the\nscheduling of the shell process running the script by the operating\nsystem is likely to make more difference if these are embedded inside a\nmuch longer script or function, as they will be. And on the other hand,\nthe connection between `&&\\' and a logical `and\\' is so strong in\nthe minds of many programmers that to anyone with moderate shell\nexperience they are perfectly readable. So it\\'s up to you. I find I use\nthe `&&\\' and `||\\' forms for a pair of simple commands, but use\n`if\\' for anything more complicated.\nI would certainly advise you to avoid chains like:\n  true || print foo && print bar || false\nIf you try that, you will see `bar\\' but not `foo\\', which is not\nwhat a C programmer might expect. Using the usual rules of precedence,\nyou would parse it as: either true must be true; or both the print\nstatements must be true; or the false must be true. However, the shell\nparses it differently, using these rules:\n\nIf you encounter an `&&\\',\nif the command before it (really the complete pipeline)\nsucceeded, execute the command immediately after, and execute\nwhat follows normally\nelse if the command failed, skip the next command and any others\nuntil an `||\\' is encountered, or until the group of commands\nis ended by a newline, a semicolon, or the end of an enclosing\ngroup. Then execute whatever follows in the normal way.\n\n\nIf you encounter an `||\\',\nif the command before it succeeded, skip the next command and\nany others until an `&&\\' is encountered, or until the end of\nthe group, and execute what follows normally\nelse if the command failed, execute the command immediately\nafter the `||\\'.\n\n\n\nIf that\\'s hard to follow, just note that the rule is completely\nsymmetric; a simple summary is that the logical connectors don\\'t\nremember their past state. So in the example shown, the `true\\'\nsucceeds, we skip `print foo\\' but execute `print bar\\' and then\nskip false. The expression returns status zero because the last thing\nit executed did so. Oddly enough, this is completely standard behaviour\nfor shells. This is a roundabout way of saying `don\\'t use combined\nchains of `&&\\'s and `||\\'s unless you think Gödel\\'s theorem is\nfor sissies\\'.\nStrictly speaking, the and\\'s and or\\'s come in a hierarchy of things\nwhich connect commands. They are above pipelines, which explains my\nremark above --- an expression like\n`echo $ZSH_VERSION | sed '/dev//'\\' is treated as a single command\nbetween any logical connectors --- and they are below newlines and\nsemicolons --- an expression like\n`true && print yes; false || print no\\' is parsed as two distinct\nsets of logically connected command sequences. In the manual, a list is\na complete set of commands executed in one go:\n  echo foo; echo bar\n\n  echo small furry animals\n--- a shell function is basically a glorified list with arguments and\na name. A sublist is a set of commands up to a newline or semicolon, in\nother words a complete expression possibly involving the logical\nconnectors:\n  show -nomoreproc | \n    grep -q foo && \n    print The word '`foo'\\' occurs.\nA pipeline is a chain of one or more commands connected by `|\\', for\nexample both individual parts of the previous sublist,\n  show -nomoreproc | grep -q foo\nand\n  print The word '`foo'\\' occurs.\ncount as pipelines. A simple command is one single unit of execution\nwith a command name, so to use the same example that includes all three\nof the following,\n  show -nomoreproc\n  grep -q foo\n  print The word '`foo'\\' occurs.\nThis means that in something like\n  print foo\nwhere the command is terminated by a newline and then executed in one\ngo, the expression is all of the above --- list, sublist, pipeline and\nsimple command. Mostly I won\\'t need to make the formal distinction; it\nsometimes helps when you need to break down a complicated set of\ncommands. It\\'s a good idea, and usually possible, to write in such a\nway that it\\'s obvious how the commands break down. It\\'s not too\nimportant to know the details, as long as you\\'ve got a feel for how the\nshell finds the next command.\n[]{#l68}\n3.8.2: Structures\nI\\'ve shown plenty of examples of one sort of shell structure already,\nthe if statement:\n  if [[ black = white ]]; then\n    print Yellow is no colour.\n  fi\nThe main points are: the `if\\' itself is followed by some command\nwhose return status is tested; a `then\\' follows as a new command;\nany number of commands may follow, as complex as you like; the whole\nsequence is ended by a `fi\\' as a command on its own. You can write\nthe `then\\' on a new line if you like, I just happen to find it\nneater to stick it where it is. If you follow the form here, remember\nthe semicolon before it; the then must start a separate command. (You\ncan put another command immediately after the then without a newline\nor semicolon, though, although people tend not to.)\nThe double-bracketed test is by far the most common thing to put here in\nzsh, as in ksh, but any command will do; only the status is important.\n  if true; then\n    print This always gets executed\n  fi\n  if false; then\n    print This never gets executed\n  fi\nHere, true always returns true (status 0), while false always\nreturns false (status 1 in zsh, although some versions return status 255\n--- anything nonzero will do). So the statements following the\nprints are correct.\nThe if construct can be extended by `elif\\' and `else\\':\n  read var\n  if [[ $var = yes ]]; then\n    print Read yes\n  elif [[ $var = no ]]; then\n    print Read no\n  else\n    print Read something else\n  fi\nThe extension is pretty straightforward. You can have as many\n`elif\\'s with different tests as you like; the code following the\nfirst test to succeed is executed. If no test succeeded, and there is an\n`else\\' (there doesn\\'t need to be), the code following that is\nexecuted. Note that the form of the `elif\\' is identical to that of\n`if\\', including the `then\\', while the else just appears on its\nown.\nThe while-loop is quite similar to if. There are two differences:\nthe syntax uses while, do and done instead of if, then and\nfi, and after the loop body is executed (if it is), the test is\nevaluated again. The process stops as soon as the test is false. So\n  i=0\n  while (( i++ prints 1, then 2, then 3. As with if, the commands in the middle can\nbe any set of zsh commands, so\n  i=0\n  while (( i++ tells you that 1 and 3 are odd while 2 is even. Remember that the\nindentation is irrelevant; it is purely there to make the structures\nmore easy to understand. You can write the code on a single line by\nreplacing all the newlines with semicolons.\nThere is also an until loop, which is identical to the while loop\nexcept that the loop is executed until the test is true.\n`until [[...\\' is equivalent to `while ! [[...\\'.\nNext comes the for loop. The normal case can best be demonstrated by\nanother example:\n  for f in one two three; do\n    print $f\n  done\nwhich prints out `one\\' on the first iteration, then `two\\', then\n`three\\'. The f is set to each of the three words in turn, and the\nbody of the loop executed for each. It is very useful that the words\nafter the `in\\' may be anything you would normally have on a shell\ncommand line. So `for f in *; do\\' will execute the body of the loop\nonce for each file in the current directory, with the file available as\n$f, and you can use arrays or command substitutions or any other kind\nof substitution to generate the words to loop over.\nThe for loop is so useful that the shell allows a shorthand that you\ncan use on the command line: try\n  for f in *; print $f\nand you will see the files in the current directory printed out, one per\nline. This form, without the do and the done, involves less typing,\nbut is also less clear, so it is recommended that you only use it\ninteractively, not in scripts or functions. You can turn the feature off\nwith NO_SHORT_LOOPS.\nThe case statement is used to test a pattern against a series of\npossibilities until one succeeds. It is really a short way of doing a\nseries of if and elif tests on the same pattern:\n  read var\n  case $var in\n    (yes) print Read yes\n          ;;\n    (no) print Read no\n         ;;\n    (*) print Read something else\n        ;;\n   esac\nis identical to the if/elif/else example above. The $var is\ncompared against each pattern in turn; if one matches, the code\nfollowing that is executed --- then the statement is exited; no\nfurther matches are looked for. Hence the `*\\' at the end, which can\nmatch anything, acts like the `else\\' of an if statement.\nNote the quirks of the syntax: the pattern to test must appear in\nparentheses. For historical reasons, you can miss out the left\nparenthesis before the pattern. I haven\\'t done that mainly because\nunbalanced parentheses confuse the system I am using for writing this\nguide. Also, note the double semicolon: this is the only use of double\nsemicolons in the shell. That explains the fact that if you type\n`;;\\' on its own the shell will report a `parse error\\'; it\ncouldn\\'t find a case to associate it with.\nYou can also use alternative patterns by separating them with a vertical\nbar. Zsh allows alternatives with extended globbing anyway; but this is\nactually a separate feature, which is present in other shells which\ndon\\'t have zsh\\'s extended globbing feature; it doesn\\'t depend on the\nEXTENDED_GLOB option:\n  read var\n  case $var in\n    (yes|true|1) print Reply was affirmative\n                 ;;\n    (no|false|0) print Reply was negative\n                 ;;\n    (*) print Reply was cobblers\n              ;;\n  esac\nThe first `print\\' is used if the value of $var read in was\n`yes\\', `true\\' or `1\\', and so on. Each of the separate items\ncan be a pattern, with any of the special characters allowed by zsh,\nthis time depending on the setting of the option EXTENDED_GLOB.\nThe select loop is not used all that often, in my experience. It is\nonly useful with interactive input (though the code may certainly appear\nin a script or function):\n  select var in earth air fire water; do\n    print You selected $var\n  done\nThis prints a menu; you must type 1, 2, 3 or 4 to select the\ncorresponding item; then the body of the loop is executed with $var\nset to the value in the list corresponding to the number. To exit the\nloop hit the break key (usually ^G) or end of file (usually ^D: the\nfeature is so infrequently used that currently there is a bug in the\nshell that this tells you to use `exit\\' to exit, which is nonsense).\nIf the user entered a bogus value, then the loop is executed with $var\nset to the empty string, though the actual input can be retrieved from\n$REPLY. Note that the prompt printed for the user input is $PROMPT3,\nthe only use of this parameter in the shell: all normal prompt\nsubstitutions are available.\nThere is one final type of loop which is special to zsh, unlike the\nothers above. This is `repeat\\'. It can be used two ways:\n  % repeat 3 print Hip Hip Hooray\n  Hip Hip Hooray\n  Hip Hip Hooray\n  Hip Hip Hooray\nHere, the first word after repeat is a count, which could be a\nvariable as normal substitutions are performed. The rest of the line (or\nuntil the first semicolon) is a command to repeat; it is executed\nidentically each time.\nThe second form is a fully fledged loop, just like while:\n  % repeat 3; do\n  repeat> print Hip Hip Hooray\n  repeat> done\n  Hip Hip Hooray\n  Hip Hip Hooray\n  Hip Hip Hooray\nwhich has the identical effect to the previous one. The `repeat>\\' is\nthe shell\\'s prompt to show you that it is parsing the contents of a\n`repeat\\' loop.\n[]{#l69}\n3.8.3: Subshells and current shell constructs\nMore catching up with stuff you\\'ve already seen. The expression in\nparentheses here:\n  % (cd ~; ls)\n  \n  % pwd\n  \nis run in a subshell, as if it were a script. The main difference is\nthat the shell inherits almost everything from the main shell in which\nyou are typing, including options settings, functions and parameters.\nThe most important thing it doesn\\'t inherit is probably information\nabout jobs: if you run jobs in a subshell, you will get no output; you\ncan\\'t use fg to resume a job in a subshell; you can\\'t use\n`kill %n\\' to kill a job (though you can still use the process ID);\nand so on. By now you should have some feel for the effect of running in\na separate process. Running a command, or set of commands, in a\ndifferent directory, as in this example, is one quite common use for\nthis construct. (In zsh 4.1, you can use jobs in a subshell; it lists\nthe jobs running in the parent shell; this is because it is very useful\nto be able to pipe the output of jobs into some processing loop.)\nOn the other hand, the expression in braces here:\n  % {cd ~; ls}\n  \n  % pwd\n  /home/pws\nis run in the current shell. This is what I was blathering on about in\nthe section on redirection. Indeed, unless you need some special effect\nlike redirecting a whole set of commands, you won\\'t use the\ncurrent-shell construct. The example here would behave just the same way\nif the braces were missing.\nAs you might expect, the syntax of the subshell and current-shell forms\nis very similar. You can use redirection with both, just as with simple\ncommands, and they can appear in most places where a simple command can\nappear:\n  [[ $test = true ]] && {\n    print Hello.\n    print Well, this is exciting.\n  }\nThat would be much clearer using an `if\\', but it works. For some\nreason, you often find expressions of this form in system start-up files\nlocated in the directory /etc/rc.d or, on older systems, in files\nwhose names begin with `/etc/rc.\\'. You can even do:\n  if { foo=bar; [[ $foo = bar ]] }; then\n    print yes\n  fi\nbut that\\'s also pretty gross.\nOne use for {...} is to make sure a whole set of commands is\nexecuted at once. For example, if you copy a set of commands from a\nscript in one window and want them to be run in one go in a shell in\nanother window, you can do:\n   % {\n   cursh>            # now paste your commands in here...\n    ...\n   cursh> }\nand the commands will only be executed when you hit return after the\nfinal `}\\'. This is also a workaround for some systems where cut and\npaste has slightly odd effects due to the way different states of the\nterminal are handled. The current-shell construct is a little bit like\nan anonymous function, although it doesn\\'t have any of the usual\nfeatures of functions --- you can\\'t pass it arguments, and variables\ndeclared inside aren\\'t local to that section of code.\n[]{#l70}\n3.8.4: Subshells and current shells\nIn case you\\'re confused about what happens in the current shell and\nwhat happens in a subshell, here\\'s a summary.\nThe following are run in the current shell.\n\nAll shell builtins and anything which looks like one, such as a\nprecommand modifier and tests with `[[\\'.\nAll complex statements and loops such as if and while. Tests and\ncode inside the block must both be considered separately.\nAll shell functions.\nAll files run by `source\\' or `.\\' as well as startup files.\nThe code inside a `{...}\\'.\nThe right hand side of a pipeline: this is guaranteed in zsh, but\ndon\\'t rely on it for other shells.\nAll forms of substitution except ` ...` , $(...),\n=(...), (...) and >(...).\n\nThe following are run in a subshell.\n\nAll external commands.\nAnything on the left of a pipe, i.e. all sections of a pipeline but\nthe last.\nThe code inside a ```(...)\\'.\nSubstitutions involving execution of code, i.e.\n` ...` , $(...), =(...), (...) and\n>(...). (TCL fans note that this is different from the\n`[...]\\' command substitution in that language.)\nAnything started in the background with `&\\' at the end.\nAnything which has ever been suspended. This is a little subtle:\nsuppose you execute a set of commands in the current shell and\nsuspend it with ^Z. Since the shell needs to return you to the\nprompt, it forks a subshell to remember the commands it was\nexecuting when you interrupted it. If you use fg or bg to\nrestart, the commands will stay in the subshell. This is a special\nfeature of zsh; most shells won\\'t let you interrupt anything in the\ncurrent shell like that, though you can still abort it with ^C.\n\nWith an alias, you can\\'t tell where it will be executed --- you need\nto find out what it expands too first. The expansion naturally takes\nplace in the current shell.\nOf course, if for some reason the current set of commands is already\nrunning in a subshell, it doesn\\'t get magically returned to the current\nshell --- so a shell builtin on the left hand side of a pipeline is\nrunning in a subshell. However, it doesn\\'t get an extra subshell, as an\nexternal command would. What I mean is:\n  { print Hello; cat file } |\n    while read line; print $line; done\nThe shell forks, producing a subshell, to execute the left hand side of\nthe pipeline, and that subshell forks to execute the cat external\ncommand, but nothing else in that set of commands will cause a new\nsubshell to be created.\n(For the curious only: actually, that\\'s not quite true, and I already\npointed this out when I talked about command substitutions: the shell\nkeeps track of occasions when it is in a subshell and has no more\ncommands to execute. In this case it will not bother forking to create a\nnew process for the cat, it will simply replace the subshell which is\nnot needed any more. This can only happen in simple cases where the\nshell has no clearing up to do.)\n[]{#l71}\n3.9: Emulation and portability\nI described the options you need to set for compatibility with ksh in\nthe previous chapter. Here I\\'m more interested in the best way of\nrunning ksh scripts and functions.\nFirst, you should remember that because of all zsh\\'s options you can\\'t\nassume that a piece of zsh code will simply run a piece of sh or ksh\ncode without any extra changes. Our old friend SH_WORD_SPLIT is the\nmost common problem, but there are plenty of others. In addition to\noptions, there are other differences which simply need to be worked\naround. I will list some of them a bit later. Generally speaking, Bourne\nshell is simple enough that zsh emulates it pretty well --- although\nbeware in case you are using bash extensions, since to many Linux users\nbash is the nearest approximation to the Bourne shell they ever come\nacross. Zsh makes no attempt to emulate bash, even though some of\nbash\\'s features have been incorporated.\nTo make zsh emulate ksh or sh as closely as it knows how, there are\nvarious things you can do.\n\nInvoke zsh under the name sh or ksh, as appropriate. You can do this\nby creating a symbolic link from zsh to sh or ksh. Then when zsh\nstarts up all the options will be set appropriately. If you are\nstarting that shell from another zsh, you can use the feature of zsh\nthat tricks a programme into thinking it has a different name:\n`ARGV0=sh zsh\\' runs zsh under the name sh, just like the\nsymbolic link method.\n\nUse `emulate ksh\\' at the top of the script or function you want\nto run. In the case of a function, it is better to run\n`emulate -L ksh\\' since this makes sure the normal options will\nbe restored when the function exits; this is irrelevant for a script\nas the options cannot be propagated to the process which ran the\nscript. You can also use the option `-R\\' after emulate, which\nforces more options to be like ksh; these extra options are\ngenerally for user convenience and not relevant to basic syntax, but\nin some cases you may want the extra cover provided.\nIf it\\'s possible the script may already be running under ksh, you\ncan instead use\n  [[ -z $ZSH_VERSION ]] && emulate ksh\nor for sh, using the simpler test command there,\n  [ x$ZSH_VERSION = x ] && emulate sh\n\n\nBoth these methods have drawbacks, and if you plan to be a heavy zsh\nuser there\\'s no substitute for simply getting used to zsh\\'s own basic\nsyntax. If you think there is some useful element of emulation we\nmissed, however, you should certainly tell the zsh-workers mailing list\nabout it.\nEmulation of ksh88 is much better than emulation of ksh93. Support for\nthe latter is gradually being added, but only patchily.\nThere is no easy way of converting code written for any csh-like shell;\nyou will just have to convert it by hand. See the FAQ for some hints on\nconverting aliases to functions.\n[]{#l72}\n3.9.1: Differences in detail\nHere are some differences from ksh88 which might prove significant for\nksh programmers. This is lifted straight from the corresponding section\nof the FAQ; it is not complete, and indeed some of the `differences\\'\ncould be interpreted as bugs. Those marked `*\\' perform in a ksh-like\nmanner if the shell is invoked with the name `ksh\\', or if `emulate\nksh\\' is in effect.\n\nSyntax:\n* Shell word splitting.\n* Arrays are (by default) more csh-like than ksh-like:\nsubscripts start at 1, not 0; array[0] refers to array[1];\n$array refers to the whole array, not $array[0]; braces are\nunnecessary: $a[1] == ${a[1]}, etc. The KSH_ARRAYS option is\nnow available.\nCoprocesses are established by coproc; |& behaves like csh.\nHandling of coprocess file descriptors is also different.\nIn cmd1 && cmd2 &, only cmd2 instead of the whole expression\nis run in the background in zsh. The manual implies this is a\nbug. Use { cmd1 && cmd2 } & as a workaround.\n\n\nCommand line substitutions, globbing etc.:\n\n* Failure to match a globbing pattern causes an error (use\nNO_NOMATCH).\n\n* The results of parameter substitutions are treated as plain\ntext: foo=\"*\"; print $foo prints all files in ksh but * in\nzsh (unset GLOB_SUBST).\n\n* $PSn do not do parameter substitution by default (use\nPROMPT_SUBST).\n\n* Standard globbing does not allow ksh-style `pattern-lists\\'.\nSee chapter 5 for a list of equivalent\nzsh forms. The ^, ~ and # (but not |) forms require\nEXTENDED_GLOB. From version 3.1.3, the ksh forms are fully\nsupported when the option KSH_GLOB is in effect.\n[1] Note that ~ is the only globbing operator to have a\nlower precedence than /. For example, **/foo~*bar* matches\nany file in a subdirectory called foo, except where bar\noccurred somewhere in the path (e.g. users/barstaff/foo will\nbe excluded by the ~ operator). As the ** operator cannot be\ngrouped (inside parentheses it is treated as *), this is the\nway to exclude some subdirectories from matching a **.\n\nUnquoted assignments do file expansion after colons (intended\nfor PATHs).\n\ninteger does not allow -i.\n\ntypeset and integer have special behaviour for assignments\nin ksh, but not in zsh. For example, this doesn\\'t work in zsh:\n        integer k=$(wc -l ~/.zshrc)\n\n\n\n\n    because the return value from `wc` includes leading whitespace\n    which causes wordsplitting. Ksh handles the assignment specially\n    as a single word.\n\nCommand execution:\n* There is no $ENV variable (use /etc/zshrc, ~/.zshrc;\nnote also $ZDOTDIR).\n$PATH is not searched for commands specified at invocation\nwithout -c.\n\n\nAliases and functions:\nThe order in which aliases and functions are defined is\nsignificant: function definitions with () expand aliases.\nAliases and functions cannot be exported.\nThere are no tracked aliases: command hashing replaces these.\nThe use of aliases for key bindings is replaced by `bindkey\\'.\n* Options are not local to functions (use LOCAL_OPTIONS; note\nthis may always be unset locally to propagate options settings\nfrom a function to the calling level).\n\n\nTraps and signals:\n* Traps are not local to functions. The option LOCAL_TRAPS is\navailable from 3.1.6.\nTRAPERR has become TRAPZERR (this was forced by UNICOS which has\nSIGERR).\n\n\nEditing:\nThe options emacs, gmacs, viraw are not supported.

(keyword will not be in the next ksh\nrelease either.)\nManagement of histories in multiple shells is different: the\nhistory list is not saved and restored after each command. The\noption SHARE_HISTORY appeared in 3.1.6 and is set in ksh\ncompatibility mode to remedy this.\n\\ does not escape editing chars (use ^V).\nNot all ksh bindings are set (e.g. #; try q).\n* # in an interactive shell is not treated as a comment by\ndefault.\n\n\nBuilt-in commands:\nSome built-ins (r, autoload, history, integer ...) were\naliases in ksh.\nThere is no built-in command newgrp: use e.g.\nalias       newgrp=\"exec newgrp\"\njobs has no -n flag.\nread has no -s flag.\n\n\nOther idiosyncrasies:\nselect always redisplays the list of selections on each loop.\n\n\n\n[]{#l73}\n3.9.2: Making your own scripts and functions portable\nThere are also problems in making your own scripts and functions\navailable to other people, who may have different options set.\nIn the case of functions, it is always best to put `emulate -L zsh\\'\nat the top of the function, which will reset the options to the default\nzsh values, and then set any other necessary options. It doesn\\'t take\nthe shell a great deal of time to process these commands, so try and get\ninto the habit of putting them any function you think may be used by\nother people. (Completion functions are a special case as the\nenvironment is already standardised --- see chapter\n6 for this.)\nThe same applies to scripts, since if you run the script without using\nthe option `-f\\' to zsh the user\\'s non-interactive startup files\nwill be run, and in any case the file /etc/zshenv will be run. We urge\nsystem administrators not to set options unconditionally in that file\nunless absolutely necessary; but they don\\'t always listen. Hence an\nemulate can still save a lot of grief.\n[]{#l74}\n3.10: Running scripts\nHere are some final comments on running scripts: they apply regardless\nof the problems of portability, but you should certainly also be aware\nof what I was saying in the previous section.\nYou may be aware that you can force the operating system to run a script\nusing a particular interpreter by putting `#!\\' and the path to the\ninterpreter at the top of the script. For example, a zsh script could\nstart with\n   #!/usr/local/bin/zsh\n   print The arguments are $*\nassuming that zsh lives in the directory /usr/local/bin. Then you can\nrun the script under its name as if it were an ordinary command. Suppose\nthe script were called `scriptfile\\' and in the current directory,\nand you want to run it with the arguments `one two forty-three\\'.\nFirst you must make sure the script is executable:\n  % chmod +x scriptfile\nand then you can run it with the arguments:\n  % ./scriptfile one two forty-three\n  The arguments are one two forty-three\nThe shell treats the first line as a comment, since it begins with a\n`#\\', but note it still gets evaluated by the shell; the system\nsimply looks inside the file to see if what\\'s there, it doesn\\'t change\nit just because the first line tells it to execute the shell.\nI put the `./\\' in front to refer to the current directory because I\ndon\\'t usually have that in my path --- this is for safety, to avoid\nrunning things which happen to have names like commands simply because\nthey were in the current directory. But many people aren\\'t so paranoid,\nand if `.\\' is in your path, you can omit the `./\\'. Hence,\nobviously, it can be anywhere else in your path: it is searched for as\nan ordinary executable.\nThe shell actually provides this mechanism even on operating systems\n(now few and far between in the UNIX world) that don\\'t have the feature\nbuilt into them. The way this works is that if the shell found the file,\nand it was executable, but running it didn\\'t work, then it will look\nfor the #!, extract the name following and run (in this example)\n`/usr/local/bin/zsh \\/scriptfile one two forty-three\\',\nwhere \\ is the path where the file was found. This is, in fact,\npretty much what the system does if it handles it itself.\nSome shells search for scripts using the path when they are given as\nfilenames at invocation, but zsh happens not to. In other words,\n`zsh scriptfile\\' only runs scriptfile in the current directory.\nThere are two other features you may want to be aware of. Both are down\nto the operating system, if that is what is responsible for the `#!\\'\ntrick (true of all the most common UNIX-like systems at the moment).\nFirst, you are usually allowed to supply one, but only one, argument or\noption in the `#!\\' line, thus:\n  #!/usr/local/bin/zsh -f\n  print other stuff here\nwhich stops startup files other than /etc/zshenv from being run, but\notherwise works the same as before. If you need more options, you should\ncombine them in the same word. However, it\\'s usually clearer, for\nanything apart from -f, -i (which forces the shell into interactive\nmode) and a few other options which need to take effect immediately, to\nput a `setopt\\' line at the start of the body of the script. In a few\nversions of zsh, there was an unexpected consequence of the fact that\nthe line would only be split once: if you accidentally left some spaces\nat the end of the line (e.g. `#!/usr/local/bin/zsh -f\\') they would\nbe passed down to the shell, which would report an error, which was hard\nto interpret. The spaces will still usually be passed down, but the\nshell is now smart enough to ignore spaces in an option list.\nThe second point is that the length of the `#!\\' line which will be\nevaluated is limited. Often the limit is 32 characters, in total, That\nmeans if your path to zsh is long, e.g.\n`/home/users/psychology/research/dreams/freud/solaris_2.5/bin/zsh\\'\nthe system won\\'t be able to find the shell. Your only recourse is to\nfind a shorter path, or execute the shell directly, or some sneakier\ntrick such as running the script under /bin/sh and making that start\nzsh when it detects that zsh isn\\'t running yet. That\\'s a fairly nasty\nway of doing it, but just in case you find it necessary, here\\'s an\nexample:\n  #!/bin/sh\n\n  if [ x$ZSH_VERSION = x ]; then\n    # Put the right path in here ---\n    # or just rely on finding zsh in\n    # $path, since `exec' handles that.\n    exec /usr/local/bin/zsh $0 \"$@\"\n  fi\n\n  print $ZSH_VERSION\n  print Hello, this is $0\n  print with arguments $*.\nNote that first `$0\\', which passes down the name of the script that\nwas originally executed. Running this as `testexec foo bar\\' gives me\n  3.1.9-dev-8\n  Hello, this is /home/pws/tmp/testexec\n  with arguments foo bar.\nI hope you won\\'t have to resort to that. By the way, really,\nexcruciatingly old versions of zsh didn\\'t have $ZSH_VERSION. Rather\nthan fix the script, I suggest you upgrade the shell. Also, on some old\nBourne shells you might need to replace \"$@\" with ${1+\"$@\"}, which\nis more careful about only putting in arguments if there were any (this\nis the sort of thing we\\'ll see in chapter 5).\nUsually this isn\\'t necessary.\nYou can use the same trick on ancient versions of UNIX which didn\\'t\nhandle `#!\\'. On some such systems, anything with a `:\\' as the\nfirst character is run with the Bourne shell, so this serves as an\nalternative to `#!/bin/sh\\', while on some Berkeley systems, a plain\n`#\\' caused csh to be used. In the second case, you will need to\nchange the syntax of the first test to be understood by both zsh and\ncsh. I\\'ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. If you have perl\n(very probable these days) you can look at the perlrun manual page,\nwhich discusses the corresponding problem of starting perl scripts from\na shell, for some ideas.\nThere\\'s one other glitch you may come across. Sometimes if you type the\nname of a script which you know is in your path and is executable, the\nshell may tell you `file not found\\', or some equivalent message.\nWhat this usually means is that the interpreter wasn\\'t found, because\nyou mistyped the line after the `#!\\'. This confusing message isn\\'t\nthe shell\\'s fault: a lot of operating systems return the same system\nerror in this case as if the script were really not found. It\\'s not\nworth the shell searching the path to see if the script is there,\nbecause in the vast majority of cases the error refers to the programme\nin the execution path. If the operating system returned the more natural\nerror, `exec format error\\', then the shell would know that there was\nsomething wrong with the file, and could investigate; but unfortunately\nlife\\'s not that simple.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide04.html":{"url":"zshguide04.html","title":"章节 4","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n[]{#zle}[]{#l75}\nChapter 4: The Z-Shell Line Editor\nThe zsh line editor is probably the first part of the shell you ever\nused, when you started typing in commands. Even the most basic shells,\nsuch as sh, provide some kind of editing capability, although in that\ncase probably just what the system itself does --- enter characters,\ndelete the last character, delete the entire line. Most shells you\\'re\nlikely to use nowadays do quite a lot more. With zsh you can even extend\nthe set of editor commands using shell functions.\n[]{#l76}\n4.1: Introducing zle\nThe zsh line editor is usually abbreviated to `zle\\'. Normally it fires\nitself up for any interative shell; you don\\'t have to do anything\nspecial until you decide you need to change its behaviour. If everything\nlooks OK and you\\'re not interested in how zle is started up, skip to\nthe next subsection.\nNowadays, zle lives in its own loadable module, zsh/zle, which saves\nall the overhead of having an editor if the shell isn\\'t interactive.\nHowever, you normally won\\'t need to worry about that; I\\'ll say more\nabout modules in chapter 7, but the shell\nknows when you need zle and gives you it automatically. Usually the\nmodule is in a directory with a name like\n`/usr/local/lib/zsh/4.0.4/zsh/zle.so\\', where the `4.0.4\\' is the\nshell\\'s version number, the same as the value of the parameter\n$ZSH_VERSION, and everything after that apart from the suffix\n`.so\\' is the module name. The suffix may be `.sl\\' (HP-UX) or\n`.dll\\' (Cygwin), but `.so\\' is by far the most common form. It\ndiffers because zsh keeps the same convention for dynamically loadable\nlibraries, or `shared objects\\' in UNIX-speak, as the operating system.\nIf the shell is badly installed, you sometimes see error messages that\nit, or a command such as `bindkey\\', couldn\\'t be loaded. That means\nthe shell couldn\\'t find `zsh/zle\\' anywhere in the module load path,\nthe array $module_path. Then you need to complain to your system\nadministrator. If you\\'ve just compiled zsh and are having this problem,\nit\\'s because you have to install the modules before you run the shell,\neven if the shell itself isn\\'t installed. You can do that by saying\n`make install.modules\\'. Then the compiled zsh should run from where\nit is.\nNote that unlike bash\\'s line editor, readline, which is an entirely\nseparate library, zle is an integral part of the shell. Hence you\nconfigure it by sticking commands in your .zshrc --- as it\\'s only\nuseful for an interactive shell, only /etc/zshrc and .zshrc make\nsense for this purpose.\nOne tip if you\\'re looking at the zsh manual using info, either with the\ncommand of that name or \\C-h i within Emacs, which I find the most\nconvenient way: the entry for zle is called `Zsh Line Editor\\', in\nfull, not just `Zle\\'. Have fun looking for `Shell Builtin Commands\\'\n(not `Builtins\\') while you\\'re at it.\n[]{#l77}\n4.1.1: The simple facts\nAs with any editor later than ed, you can move around the line and\nchange it using various `keystrokes\\', in other words one or more sets\nof keys you type at once. For example, the keystroke to move back a word\nis (maybe) ESC b. This means you first hit the escape key; nothing\nhappens yet. Then you hit `b\\', and the cursor instantly jumps back to\nthe start of the word. (I\\'ll have more to say on what zle thinks is a\n`word\\' --- it\\'s not necessarily the same as what the rest of the\nshell thinks is a word.)\nIt will probably help if I introduce the shell\\'s way of describing\nkeystrokes right away; then when you need to enter them you can just\ncopy them straight in. The escape key is `\\e\\', so that keystroke\nwould be `\\eb\\'. Other common keystrokes include holding down the\ncontrol key, probably near the bottom left of the keyboard, and typing\nanother key at the same time. The simplest way of indicate a control key\nis just to put `^\\' in front; so for example `^x^x\\' means hold\ndown control, and press `x\\' twice with control still held down. It has\nexactly the same effect as `^X^X\\'. (You may find each time you do\nthat it takes you to the start of the line and back to where you were.)\nI\\'ve already introduced the weasel word `maybe\\' to try to avoid\nlying. This is because actually zle has two modes of operation, one (the\ndefault) like Emacs, the other like vi. If you don\\'t know either of\nthose venerable UNIX editors, I suggest you stick to Emacs mode, since\nit tends to interfere a little less with what you\\'re doing, and\nfurthermore completion is a little easier. Completion is an offshoot of\nzle behaviour which is described in chapter 6\n(which, you will notice, is longer than this one).\nIf you normally use vi, you may have one or both of the environment\nvariables $EDITOR or $VISUAL set to `vi\\'. (It all works the same\nway if you use `vim\\' instead, or any editor that happens to contain\n`vi\\' such as `elvis\\'.) In that case, zle will start up in its\n`vi\\' mode, where the keystrokes are rather different. That\\'s why\nyou might have found that `\\eb\\' didn\\'t do what I said, even though\nyou had made no attempt to configure zle. You can make zle always use\neither emacs or vi mode by putting either\n  bindkey -e\nor\n  bindkey -v\nin your .zshrc. This is just one of many uses of bindkey.\nIf you\\'re not familiar with this use of the word `bind\\', it just\nmeans `make a keystroke execute a particular editor command\\'. Commands\nhave long-winded names with hyphens which give you quite a good\ndescription of what they do, such as `backward-delete-char\\'. Normal\nkeys which correspond to printable characters are usually `bound to\nself-insert\\', a perverse way of saying they do what you expect and\nshow up the character you typed. However, you can actually bind them to\nsomething else. In vi command mode, this is perfectly normal.\nActually, if you use a windowing system, you might want to say\n`bindkey -me\\', which binds a whole set of `meta\\' keys. In X\nWindows, one of the keys on your keyboard, possibly ALT, may be\ndesignated a `meta\\' key which has a special effect similar to the\ncontrol key. Bindings with the meta key held down are described a bit\nlike they are in Emacs, `\\M-b\\'. (You can specify control keys\nsimilarly, in fact, like `\\C-x\\', but `^x\\' is shorter.) Using the\n`-m\\' option to bindkey tells zsh that wherever it binds an escape\nsequence like `\\eb\\', it should also bind the corresponding meta\nsequence like `\\M-b\\'. Emacs always ties these together, but zsh\ndoesn\\'t --- you can rebind them separately. and if you want both\nsequences to be bound to a new command, you have to bind them both\nexplicitly.\nYou need to be careful with `bindkey -m\\', however; the shell can\\'t\ntell whether you are typing a character with the top bit set, or\nexecuting a command. This is likely to become worse as the UTF-8\nencoding for characters becomes more popular, since a non-ASCII\ncharacter then consists of a whole series of bytes with the top bit set.\nIf you are interested in binding function keys, you may already have\nfound the key sequences they send apparently don\\'t make any sense; see\nthe section below for more information. This\nwill introduce the function called zkbd which can make the process\nless painful. The function also helps with `meta\\' and `ALT\\' keys.\n[]{#l78}\n4.1.2: Vi mode\nI\\'m going to concentrate on Emacs mode for various reasons: firstly,\nbecause I use it myself; secondly, because the most likely reason for\nyou using vi mode is that you are already familiar with vi and don\\'t\nneed to be told how it works; thirdly, because most of the commands are\nthe same in both modes, just bound differently; and finally because if\nyou don\\'t already know vi, you will quite likely find vi editing mode\nrather counterintuitive and difficult to use.\nHowever, here are a few remarks on it just to get it out of the way.\nLike the real vi editor, there are two basic modes, insert mode, where\nyou type in text, and command mode, where the same keystrokes which\ninsert characters are bound instead to editing commands. Unlike the real\nvi, the line editor starts in insert mode on every new command you edit.\nThis means you can often simply type a line up to the `return\\' at the\nend and forget you are in vi mode at all.\nTo enter command mode, you hit `escape\\', again just like normal vi. At\nthis point you are in the magic world of vi commands, where typing an\nordinary character can have any effect whatsoever. However, the bindings\nare similar to normal vi, so `h\\' and `l\\' move left and right.\nWhen you want to insert more text, you can use any of the normal vi\ncommands which allow you to do that, such as `i\\' (vi-insert) or\n`a\\' (vi-add-next).\nApart from the separate command and insert modes and the completely\ndifferent set of key bindings, there is no basic difference between\nEmacs mode and vi mode. You can bind keys in both the vi modes ---\nthey don\\'t have to correspond to self-insert in insert mode. Below,\nI\\'ll describe `keymaps\\', a complete set of descriptions for what all\nthe keys will do (less impressive than it sounds, since a lot of keys\nmay be set to `undefined-key, which means they don\\'t do anything\nuseful), and you will see how to change the behaviour in both modes.\n[]{#l79}\n4.2: Basic editing\nIf you know Emacs or vi, you will very soon find out how to do simple\ncommands like moving the cursor, going up and down the history list, and\ndeleting and copying words. If you don\\'t, you should read the zshzle\nmanual page for a concise description of what it can do. Here is a\nsummary for Emacs mode.\n[]{#l80}\n4.2.1: Moving\nYou can move forwards and backwards along the line using the cursor\nkeys. The are a variety of different conventions as to what keystrokes\nthe cursor keys produce. You might naively expect that pressing, say,\ncursor right, sends a signal along the lines of `cursor right\\' to the\napplication. Unfortunately, there is no such character in the ASCII\ncharacter set, so programmes which read input as a string of characters\nlike zsh have to be given an arbitrary string of characters. (It\\'s\ndifferent for programmes which understand other forms of input, like\nwindowing systems.)\nThe two most common conventions for cursor keys are where the up key\nsends `\\e[A\\' and the other three the same with B, C and D at\nthe end, and the convention where the `[\\' is replaced by an `O\\'\n(uppercase letter `O\\'). In old versions of zsh, the only convention\nsupported was the first of those two. The second, and any other\nconvention, were not supported at all and you had to bind the keys\nyourself. This was done by something like:\n  bindkey \"\\eOA\" up-line-or-history\n  bindkey \"\\eOB\" down-line-or-history\n  bindkey \"\\eOC\" forward-char\n  bindkey \"\\eOD\" backward-char\nThe shell tries harder now, and provided your system has the correct\ninformation about your terminal (zsh uses an old system called\n`termcap\\' which has largely been superseded by another called\n`terminfo\\') you should be lucky. If the shell thinks your keys are too\nperverse --- in particular, if the keystroke it wants to bind the\nfunction too is already defined by zsh --- you will still have to do\nit by hand. The list above should serve as a template.\nInstead of the cursor keys, traditional Emacs keys are available: ^b\nand ^f for backward and forward, ^p and ^n for previous line and\nnext line, so you can continue even if the cursor keys don\\'t work.\nMoving longer distances is done by \\eb and \\ef for a word backwards\nor forwards (or, as you saw, \\M-b and \\M-f), and ^a and ^e for\nthe start and the end of the line. That just about exhausts the ones you\nwill use the most frequently.\n[]{#l81}\n4.2.2: Deleting\nFor deleting, backspace or the delete key will delete backwards. There\nis an eternal battle over these keys owing to the fact that on PC\nkeyboards the key at the top left of the central keyboard section is\n`backspace\\' which is the character ^h, while on traditional UNIX\nkeyboards it is `delete\\' which is the character 127, often written as\n^? (which zsh also understands). When you are in the system\\'s own\nprimitive line editing mode, as with sh (unless your sh is really bash),\nonly one of these is `bound\\', although it\\'s not really a key binding,\nit\\'s a translation made by the system\\'s terminal driver, and it\\'s\nusually the wrong one. Hence you often find the system prints `^h\\'\non the screen when you want it to delete. You can change the key using\n  stty erase '^h'\nbut zsh protects you from all that --- both ^h (backspace) and ^?\n(delete) will delete backwards one character. Note, by the way, that zsh\ndoesn\\'t understand smart names for any keystrokes -- if you try to\nbind a key called `backspace\\' zsh will bind a command to that\nsequence of characters, not a key of that name. See comments on\n`bindkey -s\\' for when something like this might even be useful.\nTo confuse matters further, the key often marked as `Delete\\' on a 101-\nor 102-key PC keyboard in the group of 6 above the cursor keys is\ncompletely different again, and probably doesn\\'t send either of those\nsequences. On my keyboard it sends the sequence `\\e[3~\\'. I find it\nconvenient to have this delete the next charater, which is its tradional\nrole in the PC world, which I do by\n  bindkey '\\e[3~' delete-char\nHowever, the tradtional Emacs way of deleting the next character is to\nuse `^d\\', which zsh binds for you by default. If you look at the\nbinding, which you can do by not giving bindkey an editor command to\nbind,\n  % bindkey '^d'\n  delete-char-or-list\nyou\\'ll see it doesn\\'t quite do what I suggested. The `-or-list\\'\npart is for completion, and you\\'ll find out about it in the next\nchapter. The first shell I know of to have this odd combination was\ntcsh.\nSince I enjoy confusion, I might as well point out that usually ^d has\nanother use, which is to tell the terminal driver you\\'ve reached the\nend of a file. In the case of, say, a file on a disk, the system knows\nthis by itself, but if you are supplying a stream of characters, the\nonly way of telling it is to send a special character. The default is\nusually ^d. You will notice that if you type `^d\\' at the start of\nthe line, you see the message\n  zsh: use 'exit' to exit.\nThat\\'s because zsh recognises the ^d as end-of-file in that position.\nBy default the shell warns you; you can turn this off by setting the\noption IGNORE_EOF. You can tell the system you don\\'t ever want to\nsend an end-of-file in this way with stty, again: the following are\nequivalent in Linux but your system way want one or the other:\n  stty eof '^-'\n  stty eof undef\nRemember that stty is not part of the shell; it\\'s a way of\ncontrolling the state of the system\\'s terminal driver. This means it\nsurvives as long as the terminal or terminal window is still connected,\neven if you start a new shell or exit one that isn\\'t the login shell.\nBy the way, if you need to refer to a character by its number, the\neasiest way is probably to use the syntax `\\x??\\', where the `??\\'\nare the two hex digits for the key. In the case of delete, it is\n`\\x7f\\'. You can confirm this by:\n  % bindkey '\\x7f'\n  \"^?\" backward-delete-char\n[]{#l82}\n4.2.3: More deletion\nYou can delete larger areas with `\\ed\\' to delete the next word and\n`\\e^h\\' or `\\e^?\\' (escape followed by delete backwards) to delete\nthe previous word. `^u\\' usually removes the entire line, before and\nafter the cursor --- this is not like Emacs, where ^u introduces\ndigit arguments as I will describe in the next subsection. It is,\nhowever, like another of those primitive editing commands the terminal\ndriver itself provides, this one being known to stty as `kill\\'.\nThe most common use of this outside zsh is for deleting your password\nwhen you login, when you know you\\'ve typed it wrong but can\\'t see how\nmany !@?*! characters you\\'ve typed, and maybe can\\'t rely on the\nterminal agreeing with you as to which of ^h or ^? will delete a\nsingle one.\nStrictly speaking, all the keystrokes in the previous paragraph perform\na `kill\\' (zsh-speak, not to be confused with the stty `kill\\')\nrather than a `delete\\' (or deletion, as we used to say when we had a\ndistinct between nouning and verbing). The difference is the same as in\nEmacs --- `killed\\' text is saved for later `yanking\\' back\nsomewhere else, which you do with the ^y key, whereas `deleted\\' text\nas with ^? and ^d is gone forever. This is what everyone not brought\nup under Emacs calls `cut\\' and `paste\\' (although since Emacs dates\nback to the seventies, it could be everyone else that\\'s wrong). Another\nfeature borrowed from Emacs is that if you do multiple `kills\\' without\nany other editing in between, the killed text is joined together and you\ncan yank it all back in one go. I will say more when I talk about point\nand mark (another Emacs idea).\nActually, even deleted text isn\\'t gone forever: zsh has an Emacs-like\nediting history, and you can undo the previous commands on the line.\nThis is usually bound to ^xu and ^x^u, and there is shorter binding\nwhich is described rather confusingly as `^_\\' --- confusingly,\nbecause on all not-completely-spaced-out keyboards I\\'ve ever used you\nactually generate that sequence by holding down control and pressing the\n`/\\' key. Zsh doesn\\'t use ^z by default and, if you are used to\nWindows, that is another suitable binding for undo.\nZsh scores in one way over Emacs --- it also has `redo\\', not bound\nby default. This means that if you undo to much, you can put back what\nyou just undid by repeatedly using the redo command.\n[]{#l83}\n4.3: Fancier editing\n[]{#l84}\n4.3.1: Options controlling zle\nUnlike completion, zle doesn\\'t have many options associated with it;\nmost of the control is done by key bindings and builtin commands. Only\ntwo are really useful; both control beeps. The option beep can be\nunset to tell the shell never to make a noise on an error; the option\nhistbeep can be unset to disable beeps only in the case of trying to\ngo back before the first or forward after the last history entry.\nThe not-very-useful options are zle and singlelinezle. The former\ncontrols whether zle is active at all and isn\\'t that useful because\nit\\'s usually on automatically whenever you need it, in other words in\ninterative shells, and off whenever you don\\'t. It\\'s sometimes useful\nto test via `[[ -o zle ]]\\', however; this lets you make a function\ndo something cleverer in an interative shell.\nThe option singlelinezle restricts editing to one line; if it gets too\nlong, it will be truncated and a `$\\' printed where the missing bits\nare. It\\'s only there for compatibility with ksh and as a safeguard if\nyour terminal is really screwed up, though even in that case zsh tries\nto guess whether everything it needs is available.\nOther functions that affect zle include the history functions. These\nwere described back in chapter 2; once you\\'ve\nset it off, searching through the history works basically the same way\nin zle as with the `!\\' history commands.\n[]{#l85}\n4.3.2: The minibuffer and extended commands\nThe `minibuffer\\' is yet another Emacs concept; it is a prompt that\nappears just under the command line for you to enter some edit required\nby the editor itself. Usually, it comes and goes as it pleases and you\ndon\\'t need to think about it. The most common uses are entering text\nfor searches, and entering a command which isn\\'t bound to a string.\nThat\\'s yet another Emacs feature: \\ex prompts you to enter the name\nof a command. Luckily, since the names tend to be rather long,\ncompletion is available. So typing `echo fooxbaw\\'\nends up with:\n  % echo foo\n  execute: backward-word\nand hitting return executes that function, taking you to the start of\nthe foo; you might be able to think of easier ways of doing that. This\ndoes provide a way of running commands you don\\'t often use.\n(I hope my notation isn\\'t too confusing. I write things like \nwhen I\\'m showing a single character you hit, to make it stand out from\nthe surrounding text. However, when I\\'m not showing text being entered,\nI would write that as `\\t\\', which is how you would enter the\ncharacter into a key sequence to be bound, or a string to be printed.)\nThe minibuffer only handles a very limited set of editing commands.\nTyping one it doesn\\'t understand usually exits whatever you were trying\nto do with the minibuffer, then executes the keystroke. However, in this\nparticular case, it won\\'t let you exit until you have finished typing a\ncommand; your only other option is to abort. The usual zle abort\ncharacter is ^g, `send-break\\'. This is different from the more\ndrastic ^c, which sends the shell itself an interrupt signal. Quite\noften they have the same effect in zle, however. (You\\'ll notice ^c is\nactually `bound to undefined-key\\', in other words zle doesn\\'t\nconsider it does anything. However, the terminal driver probably causes\nit to send an interrupt, and zle does respond to that.)\nAnother feature useful with rare commands is `where-is\\'. Surprise!\nit\\'s not bound by default, so typing `xwhere-is\\' is then the\nway of runing it. Then you type another editor command at the\n`Where is:\\' prompt, and the shell will tell you what keystrokes, if\nany, are bound to it. You can also simply use grep on the output of\nbindkey, which, with no arguments, lists all bindings.\n[]{#l86}\n4.3.3: Prefix (digit) arguments\nMany commands can be repeated by giving them a numeric prefix or digit\nargument. For example, at the end of a long line of text, type\n`4b\\'. The `b\\' on its own would take you one word\nbackwards. The `4\\' passes it the number four and it moves four\nwords backwards. Generally speaking, this works any time it make sense\nto repeat a command. It works for self-insert, too, just repeatedly\ninserting the character. If it doesn\\'t work, the prefix argument is\nsimply ignored.\nYou can build up long or negative arguments by repeating both the \\e\nand the digit or `-\\' after it; for example, `-10\\'\nspecifies minus ten. It varies from command to command how useful\nnegative numbers are, but they generally switch from backwards to\nforwards or similar: `-4\\f\\' is a pointless way of\nexecuting the same as `4b\\'.\nThe shell also has Emacs\\' `universal-argument\\' feature, but it\\'s\nnot bound by default --- in Emacs it is \\C-u, but as we\\'ve seen\nthat\\'s already in use. This is an alternative to all those escapes. If\nyou bind the command to a keystroke (it\\'s absolutely pointless as a\nshortcut otherwise), and type that key, then an option minus followed by\nany digits are remembered as a prefix. The next keystroke which is not\none of those is then executed as a command, with the prefix formed by\nthe number typed after universal-argument.\nFor example, on my keyboard, the key F12 sends the key sequence\n`\\e[[24~\\' --- see below for how to find out what functions keys\nsend. Hence I use\n  bindkey '\\e[[24~' universal-argument\nThen if I hit the characters F12, 4, 0, a, a row of forty `a\\'s\nis inserted onto the command line. I\\'m not claiming this example is\nparticularly useful.\n[]{#l87}\n4.3.4: Words, regions and marks\nWords are handled a bit differently in zsh from the way they are in most\neditors. First, there is a difference between what Emacs mode and vi\nmode consider words. That is to say, there is a difference between the\nfunctions bound by default in those modes; you can use the same\nfunctions in either mode by rebinding the keys.\nIn both vi and Emacs modes, the same logic about words applies whether\nyou are moving forward or backward a number of words, or deleting or\nkilling them; the same amount of text is removed when killing as the\ncursor would move in the other case.\nIn vi mode, words are basically the same as what vi considers words to\nbe: a sequence of alphanumeric characters together with underscores\n--- essentially, characters that can occur in identifiers, and in fact\nthat\\'s how zsh internally recognises vi `word characters\\'. There is\none slight oddity about vi\\'s wordwise behaviour, however, which you can\neasily see if you type `/a/filename/path/\\', leave insert mode with\nESC, and use `w\\' or `b\\' to go forward or backward by words\nover it. It alternates between moving over the characters in a word, and\nthe characters in the separator `/\\'.\nIn Emacs, however, it is done a bit differently. The vi `word\ncharacters\\' are always considered parts of a word, but there is a\nparameter $WORDCHARS which gives a string of characters which are\nalso part of a word. This is perhaps opposite to what you would\nexpect; given that alphanumerics are always part of a word, you might\nexpect there to be a parameter to which you add characters you don\\'t\nwant to be part of a word. But it\\'s not like that.\nAlso unlike vi, jumping a word always means jumping to a word character\nat the start of a word. There is no extra `turn\\' used up in jumping\nover the non-word characters.\nThe default value for $WORDCHARS is\n  *?_-.[]~=/&;!#$%^(){}<>\ni.e. pretty much everything and the kitchen sink. Usually, therefore,\nyou will want to remove characters which you don\\'t want to be\nconsidered parts of words; `-\\', `/\\' and `.\\' are particularly\nlikely possibilities. If you want to remove individual characters, you\ncan do it with some pattern matching trickery (next chapter):\n  % WORDCHARS=${WORDCHARS//[&.;]}\n  % print $WORDCHARS\n  *?_-[]~=/!#$%^(){}<>\nshows that the operation has removed those three characters in the\ngroup, i.e. `&\\', `.\\' and `;\\', from $WORDCHARS. The\n`//\\' indicates a global substitution: any of the characters in the\nsquare brackets is replaced by nothing.\nMany other line editors, even those like readline with Emacs bindings,\nbehave as if only identifier characters were part of a word, i.e. as if\n$WORDCHARS was empty. This is very easy to do with a zle shell\nfunction. Recent versions of zsh supply the functions\n`bash-forward-word\\', `bash-kill-word\\', and a set of other\nsimilar ones, for you to bind to keys in order to have that behaviour.\nOther behaviours are also possible by writing functions; for example,\nyou can jump over real shell words (i.e. individual command arguments)\nby using some more substitution trickery, or you can consider only\nspace-delimited words (though that\\'s not so far from what you get with\n$WORDCHARS by adding `\"`'\\@\\').\n[]{#l88}\n4.3.5: Regions and marks\nAnother useful concept from Emacs is that of regions and marks. In\nEmacs-speak `point\\' is where the cursor is and `mark\\' is somewhere\nwhere you leave a mark to come back to later. The command to set the\nmark at the current point is `^@\\' as in Emacs, a hieroglyphic which\nusually means holding down the control key and pressing the space key.\nOn some systems, such as the limited version of telnet provided with a\nwell-known non-UNIX-based windowing system, you can\\'t send this\nsequence, and you need to bind a different sequence to\nset-mark-command. One possibility is `\\e\\' (escape followed by\nspace), as in MicroEMACS. (Some X Windows configurations don\\'t allow\n^@ to work in an xterm, either, though that is usually fixable.)\nTo continue with Emacs language, the region between point and mark is\ndescribed simply as `the region\\'. In zsh, you can\\'t have this\nhighlighted, as you might be used to with editors running directly under\nwindowing systems, so the easiest way to find out the ends of the region\nis with ^x^x, exchange-point-and-mark, which I mentioned before\n--- mark, by default, is left at the beginning of the line, hence the\nbehaviour you saw above.\nVarious editing commands --- usually those with `region\\' in the\nname --- operate on this. The most usual are those which kill or copy\nthe region. Annoyingly, kill-region isn\\'t bound --- in Emacs, it\\'s\n^w, but zsh follows the tradition of having that bound to\nbackward-kill-word, even though that\\'s also available as the\ntraditional Emacs binding \\e^?. So it\\'s probably useful to rebind it.\nTo copy the region, the usual binding `\\ew\\' works.\nYou then `yank\\' back the text copied or killed at another point with\n`^y\\'. The shell implements the `kill ring\\' feature, which means if\nyou perform a yank, then type `y\\' (yank-pop) repeatedly, the\nshell cycles back through previously killed or copied text, so that you\nhave more available than just the last one.\n[]{#l89}\n4.4: History and searching\nZle has access to the lines saved in the shell\\'s history, as described\nin `Setting up history\\' in chapter 2. There\nare essentially three ways of retrieving bits of the history: moving\nback through it line by line, searching back for a matching line, and\nextracting individual words from the history. In fact, the first two are\npretty similar, and there are hybrid commands which allow you to move\nback step by step but still matching only particular lines.\n[]{#l90}\n4.4.1: Moving through the history\nThe simplest behaviour is what you get with the normal cursor key\nbindings, `up-line-or-history\\' and `down-line-or-history\\'. If\nyou are in text which fits into a single line (which may be a\ncontinuation line, i.e. it has a new prompt in the form given by $PS2\nat the start of the line), this replaces the entire line with the line\nbefore or after in the history. The history is not circular, it has a\nbeginning and an end. The beginning is the first line still remembered\nby the shell (i.e. $HISTSIZE lines back, taking into account that the\nactual number of lines present will be modified by the effects of any\nspecial history options you have set to remove unwanted lines); the end\nis the line you are typing. You can use \\e and \\e> to go to the\nfirst and last line in the history.\nThe last phrase sounds trivial but isn\\'t quite. Type\n`echo This is the last line\\', go back a few lines with the up arrow,\nand then back down to the end, and you will see what I mean --- the\nshell has remembered the line you were typing, even though it hadn\\'t\nbeen entered, so you can scroll up and down the history and still come\nback to it.\nOf course, you can edit any of the earlier history lines, and hit\n`return\\' so that they are executed --- that\\'s the whole point of\nbeing able to scroll back through the history. What is maybe not so\nobvious is that the shell will remember changes you make to these lines,\ntoo, until you hit `return\\'.\nFor example, type `echo this is the last line\\' at a new shell\nprompt, but don\\'t hit return. Now hit the up arrow once, and edit the\nprevious line to say `echo this is the previous line\\'. If you scroll\ndown and up, you will see that the shell has kept both of those lines.\nWhen you decide which one to use and hit return, that line is executed\nand added to the end of the history, and any changes to previous lines\nin the history are forgotten.\nSometimes you don\\'t want to add a new line to history, instead\nre-execute a whole series of earlier commands one by one. This can be\ndone with ^o, accept-line-and-down-history. When you hit ^o on a\nline in the history, that is executed, and the line after it in the\nhistory is shown. So you just need to keep hitting it to keep executing\nthe commands.\nThere are two other similar commands I don\\'t use as much,\ninfer-next-history, bound to ^x^n, and\naccept-and-infer-next-history, not bound by default. `Inferring\\' the\nnext history means that the shell looks at what is in the current line,\nwhatever its provenance --- you might just have typed it, for example\n--- and looks back in the history for a matching line; the\n`inferred\\' next history line is the one following that line. In the\nfirst case, you are simply shown that line; in the second case, the\ncurrent line is executed first, then you are shown the inferred line.\nFeel free to drop me a line if you find this is the best thing since\nsliced bread.\nOne slight confusion about the history is that it can be hard to\nremember quite where you are in it, for example, if you were editing a\nline and had to scroll back to look for something else. In cases like\nthis, \\e> is your friend, as it takes you the last line. Also,\nwhenever you hit return, you are guaranteed to be at the end of the\nhistory, even if you were editing a line some back in the history,\nunlike certain other systems (though accept-line-and-down-history can\nemulate those). So it\\'s usually not too hard to stay unconfused about\nwhat you\\'re editing.\n[]{#l91}\n4.4.2: Searching through the history\nZsh has the commands you would expect to search through the history,\ni.e. where you hit a search key and then type in the words to search\nfor. However, it also has other features, probably more used by the zsh\ncommunity, where the search is based on some feature of the current\nline, in particular the first word or the line up to the cursor\nposition. These typically enable you to search backwards more quickly,\nsince you don\\'t need to tell the shell what you are looking for.\nOrdinary searching\\\nThe standard search commands, by which I mean the ones your are probably\nmost familiar with from ordinary text editors (if either Emacs or vi can\nbe so called), are designed to make Emacs and vi users feel at home.\nIn Emacs mode, you have incremental search: ^r to search backwards\n--- this is usually what you want, since you usually start at the end\n--- and ^s to search forwards. Note that ^s is another keystroke\nwhich is often intercepted by the terminal driver; in this case, it\nusually freezes output to the terminal until you type ^q to turn it\nback on. If you don\\'t like this, you can either use `stty stop\\' and\n`stty start\\' to change the characters, or simply\n`unsetopt flowcontrol\\' to turn that feature off altogether. However,\nthe command bound to ^s, history-incremental-search-forward, is also\nbound to ^xs, so you can use that instead.\nAs in Emacs, for each character that you type, incremental search takes\nyou to the nearest history entry that matches all the characters, until\nthe match fails. Typing the search keystroke again at any point takes\nyou to the next match for the characters in the minibuffer.\nIn vi command mode, the keystrokes available by default are the familiar\n`/\\' and `?\\'. There are various differences from vi, however.\nFirst of all, it is `/\\' that searches backwards --- this is the\none you will use more often. Secondly, you can\\'t search for regular\nexpressions (patterns); the only exception is that the character `^\\'\nat the start anchors the search to the start of a line. Everything else\nis just a plain string.\nThe other two standard vi search keystrokes are also present: `n\\'\nsearches for the next match of the current string, and `N\\' does the\nsame but reverses the direction of the search.\nSearch for the first word\\\nThe next sort of search is probably the most commonly used, but is only\nbound in Emacs mode: \\ep and \\en search forward or backward for the\nnext history line with the same first word as the current line. So often\nto reuse a command you will type just the command name itself, and hit\n\\ep until the command line you want appears. These commands are called\nsimply `history-search-backward\\' and `history-search-forward\\';\nthe name doesn\\'t really describe the function all that well.\nPrefix searching\\\nFinally, you can search backwards for a line which has the entire\nstarting point up to the cursor position the same as the current line.\nThis gives you a little more control than history-search-direction.\nThe corresponding commands, history-beginning-search-backward and\nhistory-beginning-search-forward, are not bound by default. I find it\nuseful to have them bound to ^xp and ^xn since this is similar to\nthe initial-word searches:\n  bindkey '^xp' history-beginning-search-backward\n  bindkey '^xn' history-beginning-search-forward\nOther search commands based on functions\\\nSearch commands are one of the types most often customised by writing\nshell functions. Some are supplied with the latest versions of the\nshell; have a look in the ZLE section of the zshcontrib manual page.\nYou should find the functions themselves installed somewhere in your\n$fpath, typically\n  /usr/local/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/functions\nor in the subdirectory Zle of that directory, depending how your\nversion of zsh was installed. If the shell was pre-installed, the most\nlikely location is\n  /usr/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/functions/Zle\nThese should guide you in writing your own.\nOne point to note is that when called from a function the\nhistory-search-direction and\nhistory-incremental-search-direction can take a string argument\nspecifying what to search for. In the first case, this is just a one off\nsearch, while in the second, you remain in incremental search and the\nstring is used to prime the minibuffer, so you can edit it. I will later\nsay much more about writing zle functions, but calling a search command\nfrom a user-defined editing function is as simple as:\n  zle history-search-backward search-string\nand you can test the return status to see if the search succeeded.\n[]{#l92}\n4.4.3: Extracting words from the history\nSometimes instead of editing a previous line you just want to extract a\nword from it into the current line. This is particularly easy if the\nword is the last on the line, and the line isn\\'t far back in the\nhistory: just hit \\e. repeatedly, and the shell will cycle through the\nlast word on previous lines. You can give this a prefix argument to pick\nthe Nth from last word on the line just above the last line you picked\na word from. As you can tell from the description, this gets a little\nhairy; version 4.1 of the shell will probably provide a slightly more\nflexible version.\nAlthough it\\'s strictly not to do with the history, you can copy the\nprevious word on the current line with copy-prev-word, which for some\nreason is bound to \\e^_, escape followed (probably) by control and\nslash. I have this bound to \\e= instead (in some versions of ksh that\nkey sequence is taken by the equivalent of list-choices). This copies\nwords delimited by whitespace, but you can copy what the shell would see\nas the previous complete argument by using copy-prev-shell-word\ninstead. This isn\\'t bound by default, as it is newer than the other\none, but it is arguably more useful.\nSometimes you want to complete a word from the history; this is possible\nusing the completion system, described in the next chapter.\n[]{#l93}\n4.5: Binding keys and handling keymaps\nThere are two topics to cover under the heading of key bindings: first,\nhow to bind keys themselves, and secondly, keymaps and how to use them.\nManipulating both key bindings and keymaps is done with the bindkey\ncommand. The first topic is the more immediately useful, so I\\'ll start\nwith that.\n[]{#l94}\n4.5.1: Simple key bindings\nYou\\'ve already seen basic use of bindkey to link editing commands to\na particular sequence of keys. You\\'ve seen the shorthand for naming\nkeys, with \\e being escape and ^x the character x pressed while\nthe control key is held down. I even said something about `meta\\' key\nbindings.\nLet me now launch into a little more detail. When you bind a key\nsequence, which you do with `bindkey key-sequence\neditor-command\\', the key-sequence can consist of as many characters\nas you like. It doesn\\'t even matter (much) if some initial set of the\nkey sequence is already bound. For example, you can do,\n  bindkey '\\eA' backward-word\n  bindkey '\\eAA' beginning-of-line\nHere, I\\'ll follow the shell documentation in referring to \\eA as the\nprefix of \\eAA.\nThis introduces two points. First, note that the binding for \\eA is\ndistinct from that for \\ea; you will see the latter still does\naccept-and-hold (in Emacs mode), which means it excutes the current\nline, then gives it back to you for editing --- useful for doing a lot\nof quite similar tasks. Meanwhile, \\eA takes you back a word.\nThis case sensitivity only applies to alphabetic characters which are a\ncomplete key in their own right, not to those characters with the\ncontrol key held down --- ^x and ^X are identical. (You may have\nfound there are ways to bind both separately in Emacs when running under\na windowing system, since the windowing system can tell Emacs if the\nshift key is held down with the others; it\\'s not that simple if you are\nusing an ordinary terminal.)\nIf you entered both those bindkey commands, you may notice that there\nis a short pause before \\eA takes effect. That\\'s because it\\'s\nwaiting to see if you type another A. If you do type the extra A\nduring that pause, you will be taken to the beginning of the line\ninstead. That pause is how the shell decides whether to execute the\nprefix on its own.\nThe time it waits is configurable and is given by the parameter\n$KEYTIMEOUT, which is the delay in hundredths of a second. The default\nis 40, i.e. four tenths of a second. Its use is usually down to personal\npreference; if you don\\'t type very fast, you might want to increase it,\nat the expense of a longer delay when you are waiting for the prefix to\nbe executed. If you are editing on a remote machine over a very slow\nlink, you also may need to increase it to be able to get full key\nsequences which have such a prefix to work at all.\nHowever, the shell only has this ambivalent behaviour if a prefix is\nbound in its own right; if the initial key or keys don\\'t mean anything\non their own, it will wait as long as you like for you to type a full\nsequence which is bound. This is by far the normal case. The only common\nexample of a separately bound prefix is in vi insert mode, where \ntakes you back to command mode, while there may be other bindings\nstarting with \\e such as the cursor keys. We\\'ll see below how you can\nremove those if they offend your sense of vi purity. (Don\\'t laugh, vi\nusers are strange.)\nNote that if the whole sequence is not bound, after all, the shell will\nabort as soon as it reads a complete key sequence which is no longer a\nprefix. For example, if you type `\\e[\\', the chances are the shell is\nwaiting for more, but if you add a `/\\', say, it will probably decide\nyou are being silly and abort. The next key you type then starts a new\nsequence.\n[]{#l95}\n4.5.2: Removing key bindings\nIf you want to remove a key binding, you can simply bind it to something\nelse. Near all uses of the bindkey and zle commands are smart about\nremoving dead wood in such cases. However you can also use\n`bindkey -r key-sequence\\' to remove the binding explicitly. You\ncan also simply bind the sequence to the command undefined-key; this\nhas exactly the same effect --- even down to pruning completely any\nbindings for long sequences. For example, suppose you bind\n`\\e\\C-x\\C-x\\' to a command, then to undefined-key. All memory that\n`\\e\\C-x\\C-x\\' was ever bound is removed; \\e\\C-x will no longer be\nmarked as a prefix key, unless you had some other binding with that\nprefix.\nYou can remove all bindings starting with a given prefix by adding the\n`-p option. The example given in the manual,\n  bindkey -rpM viins '\\e'\n(except it uses the equivalent form `^[\\') is amongst the most\nuseful, as it will remove the annoying delay after you type `\\e\\' to\nenter vi command mode. The delay is there because the cursor keys\nusually also start with \\e and the shell is waiting to see if you\nactually typed one of those. So if you can make do without cursor keys\nin vi insert mode you may want to consider this.\nNote that any binding for the prefix itself is not removed. In this\nexample, \\e stays bound as it was in the viins keymap, presumably to\nvi-cmd-mode.\nAll manipulations like this are specific to one particular keymap. You\nneed to repeat them with a different -M ... option argument, which\nis described below, to have the same effect in other keymaps.\n[]{#l96}\n4.5.3: Function keys and so on\n[]{#fkeys}\nIt\\'s usually possible to bind the function keys on your keyboard,\nincluding the specially named ones such as `Home\\' and `Page Up\\'. It\ndepends a good deal on how your windowing system or terminal driver\nhandles them, but these days it\\'s nearly always the case that a well\nset-up system will allow the function keys to send a string of\ncharacters to the terminal. To bind the keys you need to find out what\nthat string is.\nLuckily, you are usually aided by the fact that only the first character\nof the string is `funny\\', i.e. does something other than insert a\ncharacter. So there is a trick for finding out what the sequence is. In\na shell window, hit ^v (if you are using vi bindings, you will need to\nbe in insert mode), then the function key in question. You will probably\nsee a string like `^[OP\\' --- this is what I get from the F1 key. A\nnote in my .zshrc suggests I used to get `\\e[11~\\', so be prepared\nfor something different, even if, like me, you are using a standard\nxterm terminal emulator. A quick poll of terminal emulators on this\nLinux/GNU/XFree86 system suggests these two possibilities are by far the\nmost popular.\nYou may even be able to get different sequences by holding down shift or\ncontrol as well (after pressing ^v, of course). On my keyboard,\ncombining F1 with shift gives me `^[O2P\\', with control `^[O5P\\'\nand with both `^[O6P\\'. Again, your system may do something\ncompletely different.\nIf you move the cursor back over that `^[\\', you\\'ll find it\\'s a\nsingle character --- you can position the cursor over the `^\\', but\nnot the `[\\'. This is zsh\\'s way of inserting a real, live escape\ncharacter into the line. In fact, if you type\n  bindkey '\nthen ^v, the function key, and the other single quote, you have a\nperfectly acceptable way of binding the key on the command line. Zsh is\ngenerally quite relaxed about your use of unprintable characters; they\nmay not show up correctly on your terminal, but the shell is able to\nhandle all single-byte characters. It doesn\\'t yet have support for\nthose longer than a single byte, however.\nYou can also do the same in your .zshrc; the shell will handle strange\ncharacters in input without a murmur. You can also use the two\ncharacters `^[\\', which is just another way of entering an escape\nkey. However, the kosher thing to do is to turn it into `\\e\\'. For\nexample,\n  bindkey '\\e[OP'  where-is           # F1\n  bindkey '\\e[O2P' universal-argument # shift F1\nand so on. Using this, you can give sensible meanings to `Home\\',\n`End\\', etc. Note the windowing system\\'s sensible way of avoiding the\nproblem with prefixes --- any extra characters are inserted before the\nfinal character, so the shell can easily tell when the sequence is\ncomplete without having to wait and see if there is more to follow.\nThere is a utility supplied with zsh called zkbd which can help with\nall of this by finding out and remembering the definitions for you. You\ncan probably use it simply by autoloading it and running it, as it is\nusually installed with the other functions. It should be reasonably\nself-explanatory, else consult the zshcontrib manual.\nIf you are using X Windows and are educated enough, you can tinker with\nyour .Xdefaults file to tweak how keys are interpreted by the terminal\nemulator. For example, the following turns the backspace key into a\ndelete key in anything using a `VT100 widget\\', which is the basis of\nxterm\\'s usual mode of operation:\n  *VT100.Translations: #override \\ \n  BackSpace: string(0x7F)\nPart of the reason for showing this is that it makes zsh\\'s key binding\nsystem look wonderfully streamlined by comparison. However, tinkering\naround at this level gives you very much more control over the use of\nkey modifiers (shift, alt, meta, control, and maybe even super and hyper\nif you\\'re lucky). This is far beyond the scope of this guide ---\nwhich I say, as you probably realise by now, to cover up for not knowing\nmuch about it. Here\\'s another example from Oliver Kiddle, though; it\nuses control with the left-cursor key to send an escape sequence: insert\n  CtrlLeft: string(0x1b) string(\"[159q\") \\n\\\ninto the middle of the example above --- this shows how multiple\ndefinitions are handled. Modern xterms already send special escape\nsequences which you can investigate and bind to as I\\'ve described.\n[]{#l97}\n4.5.4: Binding strings instead of commands\nIt\\'s possible to assign an arbitrary string of characters to a key\nsequence instead of an editor command by giving bindkey the option\n-s. One of the good things about this is that the string of characters\nare reinterpreted by zle, so they can contain active key sequences. In\nthe old days, this was quite often used as a basic form of macro, to\nstring together editor commands. For example, the following is a simple\nway of moving backward two words by repeating the Emacs mode bindings.\nI\\'ve used my F1 binding again; yours may be completely different.\n  bindkey -s '\\e[OP' '\\eb\\eb'\nIt\\'s not a good idea to bind a key sequence to another string which\nincludes itself.\nThis method has the obvious drawback that if someone comes along and\nrebinds `\\eb\\', then F1 will stop working, too. Nowadays, this sort\nof task can be done much more flexibly and clearly by writing a\nuser-defined widget, which is described in a later section. So bindings\nof this sort are going a little out of fashion. However, they do provide\nquick shortcuts. Two from Oliver Kiddle:\n  bindkey -s '^[[072q' '^V^I'                       # Ctrl-Tab\n  bindkey -s \"\\C-x\\C-z\" \"\\eqsuspend\\n\"\nYou can also quite easily do some of the things you can do with global\naliases.\nRemember that `ordinary\\' characters can be rebound, too; they just\nusually happen to have a binding which makes them be inserted directly.\nAs a particularly pointless example, consider:\n  bindkey -s secret 'Oh no!'\nIf you type `secret\\' fast enough the letters are swallowed up and\n`Oh no!\\' appears instead. If you pause long enough anywhere in the\nmiddle, the word is inserted just as normal. That\\'s because all parts\nof it can be interpreted as prefixes in their own right, so\n$KEYTIMEOUT applies at every intervening stage. Less pointlessly, you\ncould use this as a way of defining abbreviations.\n[]{#l98}\n4.5.5: Keymaps\nSo far, all I\\'ve said about keymaps is that there are three standard\nones, one for Emacs mode and two for vi mode, and that `bindkey -e\\'\nand `bindkey -v\\' pick Emacs or vi insert mode bindings. There\\'s no\nsimple way of picking vi command mode bindings, since that\\'s not\nusually directly available but entered by the vi-cmd-mode command,\nusually bound to \\e, in vi insert mode. (There is a `bindkey -a\\',\nbut that doesn\\'t pick the keymap for normal use; it\\'s equivalent to,\nbut less clear than, `bindkey -M vicmd\\'.)\nMost handling of keymaps is done through bindkey. The keymaps have\nshort names, emacs, viins and vicmd, for use with bindkey. There\nis also a keymap .safe which you don\\'t usually need but which never\nchanges, so can be used if your experimentation has completely ruined\nevery other keymap. It only has bindings for self-insert (most keys)\nand accept-line (^j and ^m), but that\\'s enough to enter commands.\nThe names are most useful in two places. First, you can use\n`bindkey -M keymap\\' to define keys in a particular map:\n  bindkey -M vicmd \"\\e[OA\" up-line-or-history\nbinds the usual up-cursor key in vicmd mode, whatever keymap is\ncurrently set. Actually, any version of the shell which understands the\n-M option probably has that bound already.\nSecondly, you can force zle to use a particular keymap. This is done in\na slightly non-obvious way: zle always uses the keymap main as the\ncurrent keymap (except when it\\'s off in vi command mode, which is\nhandled a bit specially). To use your own, you need to make main an\nalias for that with `bindkey -A\\'. The order after this is the same\nas that after ln: the existing keymap you want to refer to comes\nfirst, then what you want to make an alias for it, in this case main.\nThis means that\n  bindkey -A emacs main\nhas the same effect as\n  bindkey -e\nbut is more explicit, if a little more baroque. Don\\'t link vicmd to\nmain, since then you can\\'t use viins, which is bad. Note that\n`bindkey -M emacs\\' doesn\\'t have this effect; it simply lists the\nbindings in the emacs keymap.\nYou can create your own keymaps, too. The easiest way is to copy an\nexisting keymap, such as\n  bindkey -N mymap emacs\nwhich creates (or replaces) mymap and initialises it with the bindings\nfrom emacs. Now you can use mymap just like emacs. The bindings in\neach are completely separate. If you finish with a keymap, you can\nremove it with `bindkey -D keymap\\', although you\\'d better make sure\nit\\'s not linked to main first.\nYou can omit `emacs\\' to create an empty keymap; this might be\nappropriate if your keymap is only going to be used in certain special\nplaces and you want complete control on what goes into it. Currently the\nshell isn\\'t very good at letting you apply your own keymaps just in\ncertain places, however.\nThere are various other keymaps you might encounter, used in special\ncircumstances. If you list all keymaps, which is done by\n`bindkey -l\\', you may see listscroll and menuselect. These are\nused by the new completion system, so if that isn\\'t active, you\nprobably won\\'t see them. They reside in the module zsh/complist.\nThere will be more about their effects in chapter\n6; listscroll allows you to move up and down\ncompletion lists which more than fill the terminal window, and\nmenuselect allows you to select items interactively from a displayed\nlist. You can bind keys in them as with any other keymap.\n[]{#l99}\n4.6: Advanced editing\n(In physics, the `advanced wave\\' is a hypothetical wave which moves\nbackwards in time. Unfortunately, however useful it would be to meet\ndeadlines, that\\'s not what I meant by `advanced editing\\'.)\nHere are are a few bits and pieces which go beyond ordinary line editing\nof shell commands. Although they haven\\'t been widespread in shells up\nto now, I use all of them every day, so they aren\\'t just for the\npostgraduate zsh scholar.\n[]{#l100}\n4.6.1: Multi-line editing\nAll Bourne-like shells allow you to edit continuation lines; that is, if\nthe shell can work out for sure that you haven\\'t finished typing, it\nwill show you a new prompt, given by $PS2, and allow you to continue\nwhere you left off from the previous line. In zsh, you can even see what\nit is the shell is waiting for. For a simple example, type\n`array=(first\\' and then `return\\'. The shell is waiting for the\nfinal parenthesis of the array, and prints `array>\\' at you, unless\nyou have altered $PS2. You can continue to add elements to the array\nuntil you close the parentheses.\nShells derived from csh are less happy about continuation lines;\nhistorically, this is because they try to evaluate everything in one go,\nand became confused if they couldn\\'t. The original csh didn\\'t have a\nparticularly sophisticated parser. For once, zsh doesn\\'t have an option\nto match the csh behaviour; you just have to get used to the idea that\nthings work in zsh.\nWhere zsh improves over other shells is that you aren\\'t just limited to\nediting a single continuation line; you can actually edit a whole block\nof lines on screen as you would in a full screen editor --- although\nyou can\\'t scroll off the chunk of lines you\\'re editing, which\nwouldn\\'t make sense.\nThe easiest way of doing this is to hit escape before you type a newline\nat the point where you haven\\'t finished typing. Actually, you can do\nthis any time, even if the line so far is complete. For example,\n  % print This is line one\n  print This is line two\nwhere those angle brackets at the end of the line means you type escape,\nthen return. Nothing happens, and there is no new prompt; you just type\nblithely on. Hit return, unescaped this time, and both lines will be\nexecuted. Note there is no implicit backslash, or anything like that;\nwhen zsh reads the whole caboodle, that escaped carriage return became a\nreal carriage return, just as the shell would have read it from a\nscript.\nThis works because `\\e\\r\\' is actually bound to the command\nself-insert-unmeta\\' which means `insert the character you get by\nstripping the escape or top bit from what I just typed\\' --- in other\nwords, a literal carriage return. You would have got exactly the same\neffect by typing ^v^j, since the ^v likewise escapes the ^j\n(newline), as it does any other character.\n(Aside for the terminally curious only: Why newline here and not\ncarriage return --- the `enter\\' key --- as you might expect?\nThat\\'s a rather grotesque story. It turns out that for mostly\nhistorical reasons UNIX terminal drivers like to swap newline and\ncarriage return, so when you type carriage return (sent both by that key\nand by ^m, which is the same as the character represented by \\r), it\ncomes out as newline (on most keyboards, just sent by ^j, which is the\nsame as the character represented by \\n). It is the newline character\nwhich is the one you `see\\' at the end of the line (by virtue of the\nfact it is the end of the line). However, ^v sees through this and if\nyou type ^m after it, it inserts a literal ^m, which just looks like\na ^m because that\\'s how zsh outputs it. So that\\'s why that doesn\\'t\nwork. Actually, self-insert-unmeta would see the ^m, too, because\nthat\\'s what you get when you strip off the \\e, but it has a little\nextra code to make UNIX users feel at home, and behaves as if it were a\nnewline. Normally, ^j and ^m are treated the same way\n(accept-line), but the literal characters have different behaviours.\nIf you\\'re now very confused, just be thankful I haven\\'t told you about\nthe additional contortions which go on when outputting a newline.)\nIt probably doesn\\'t seem particularly useful yet, because all you\\'ve\ndone is miss out a new prompt. What makes it so is that you can now go\nup and down between the two (or more) lines just using the cursor keys.\nI\\'m assuming you haven\\'t rebound the cursor keys, your terminal isn\\'t\na dumb one which doesn\\'t support cursor up, and the option\nsinglelinezle isn\\'t in effect --- just unset it if it is, you\\'ll\nbe grateful later.\nSo for example, type\n  % if [[ true = false ]]; then\n    print Fuzzy logic rules\n  fi\nwhere I indented that second line just with spaces, because I usually do\ninside an `if\\'. There are no continuation prompts here, just the\noriginal $PS1; that\\'s not a misprint. Now, before hitting return,\nmove up two lines, and edit false to true. You can see how this can\nbe useful. Entering functions at the command line is probably a more\ntypical example.\nSuppose you\\'ve already gone through a few continuation lines in the\nnormal way with $PS2\\'s? You can\\'t scroll back then, even though the\nblock hasn\\'t yet been edited. There\\'s a magic way of turning all those\ncontinuation lines into a single block: the editor command\npush-line-or-edit. If you\\'re not on a continuation line, it acts like\nthe normal push-line command, which we\\'ll meet below, but for present\npurpose you use it when you are on a continuation line. You are\npresented with a seamless block of text from the (redrawn) prompt to the\nend which you can edit as one. It\\'s quite reasonable to bind\npush-line-or-edit instead of push-line, to either ^q or \\eq (in\nEmacs mode, which I will assume, as usual). Be careful with ^q, though\n--- if the option flowcontrol is set it will probably be swallowed\nup by the terminal driver and not get through to the shell, the same\nproblem I mentioned above for ^s.\n[]{#l101}\n4.6.2: The builtin vared and the function zed\nI mentioned the vared command in chapter 3;\nit uses the normal line editor to editor a variable, typically a long\none you don\\'t want to have to type in completely like $path, although\nyou need to remember not to put the `$\\' in front or the shell will\nsubstitute it before vared is run. However, since it\\'s just a piece\nof text like any other input, this, too, can have multiple lines, which\nyou enter in the same way --- and since a shell parameter can contain\nanything at all, you have a pretty general purpose editor. The shell\nfunction `zed\\' is supplied with the shell and allows you to edit a\nfile using all the now-familiar commands. Since when editing files you\ndon\\'t expect a carriage return to dump you out of the editor, just to\ninsert a new line, zed rebinds carriage return to self-insert-unmeta\n(the `-unmeta\\' here is just to get the swapping behaviour of turning\nthe carriage return into a newline). To save and exit, you can type\n^j, or, if your terminal does something odd with that, you can also\nuse ^x^w, which is designed to look like Emacs\\' way of writing a\nfile.\nIf you look at zed, you will see it has a few bells and whistles ---\nfor example, `zed -f\\' allows you to edit a function --- but the\ncode to read a file into a parameter, edit the parameter, and write the\nparameter back to the file is extremely simple; all the hard editing\ncode is already handled within vared. Indeed, zed is essentially a\ncompletely general purpose editor, though it quickly becomes inefficient\nwith long files, particularly if they are larger than a single screen;\nas you would expect, zle was written to cope efficiently with short\nchunks of text.\nIt would probably be nice if you could make key bindings that only\napplied within vared by using a special keymap. That may happen one day.\nBy the way, note that you can edit arrays with vared and it will handle\nthe different elements sensibly. As usual, whitespace separates\nelements; when it presents you with an array which contains whitespace\nwithin elements, vared will precede it with a backslash to show it\nisn\\'t a separator. You can insert quoted spaces with backslashes\nyourself. Only whitespace characters need this quoting, and only\nbackslashes work.\nFor example,\n  array=('one word' 'two or more words')\n  vared array\npresents you with `one\\ word two\\ or\\ more\\ words\\'. If you add\n`and\\ some\\ more.\\', hit return, and type `print -l $array\\' to\nshow one element per line you will see\n  one word\n  two or more words\n  and some more.\nSome older versions of the shell were less careful about spaces within\nelements.\n[]{#l102}\n4.6.3: The buffer stack\nThe mysterious other use for push-line-or-edit will now be explained.\nLet\\'s stick to push-line, in fact, since I\\'ve already dealt with the\n-or-edit bit.\nType\n  print I was just in the directory\n(no newline). Oh dear, which directory were you just in? You don\\'t want\nto interrupt the flow of text to find out. Hit `\\eq\\'; the line\nyou\\'ve been typing disappears --- but don\\'t worry, it hasn\\'t gone.\nNow type\n  dirs\nTwo things happen: that last line is executed, of course, showing the\nlist of directories on the directory stack (your use of pushd and\npopd), but also the line you got rid of before has reappeared, so you\ncan continue to edit it.\nYou may not realise straight away quite how useful this is, but I used\nit several times just while I was writing the previous paragraph. For\nexample, I was alternating directories between the zle source code and\nthe directory where I keep this guide, and I started typing a `grep\\'\ncommand before realising I was in the wrong directory. All I need to do\nis type \\eq, then pushd, to put me where I want to be, and finish\noff the grep.\nThe `buffer stack\\', which is the jargon for this mechanism, can go as\ndeep as you like. It\\'s a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack, so the line\npushed onto it by the most recently typed \\eq will reappear first,\nfollowed by the back numbers in reverse order. You can even prime the\nbuffer stack from a function --- not necessarily a zle function,\nthough that works too --- with `print -z command-line\\'.\nYou can pull something explicitly off the stack, if you want, by typing\n\\eg, but that has the same effect as clearing the current line and\nhitting return. You can of course push the same line multiple times: if\nyou need to do a whole series of things before executing it, just hit\n\\eq again each time the line pops back up.\nI lied a little bit, to avoid confusion. The cleverness of\npush-line-or-edit about multi-line buffers extends to the this case,\ntoo. If you do a normal push-line on a multi-line buffer, only the\ncurrent single line is pushed; the command to push the whole lot, which\nis probably what you want, is push-input. But if you have\npush-line-or-edit bound, you can forget the distinction, since it will\ndo that for you. If you\\'ve been paying attention you can work out the\nfollowing sequence (assuming \\eq has been rebound to\npush-line-or-edit):\n  % if [[ no = yes ]]; then\n  then> printqq\nThe first \\eq turns the two lines into a single buffer, then the\nsecond pushes the whole lot onto the buffer stack. This saves a lot of\nthinking about bindings. Hence I would recommend users of Emacs mode add\n  bindkey '\\eq' push-line-or-edit\nto their .zshrc and forget the distinctions.\n[]{#l103}\n4.7: Extending zle\nWe now come to the newest and most flexible part of zle, the ability to\ncreate new editing commands, as complicated as you like, using shell\nfunctions. This was originally introduced by Andrew Main (`Zefram\\') in\nzsh 3.1 and so is standard in all versions of zsh 4, although work goes\non.\n[]{#l104}\n4.7.1: Widgets\nIf you don\\'t speak English as you first language, first of all,\ncongratulations for getting this far. Secondly, you may think of\n`widget\\' only as a technical word applied to the object which realises\nsome computational idea, like the thing that implements text editing in\na window system, for example. However, to most English speakers,\n`widget\\' is a humorous word for an object, a bit like\n`whatyoumacallit\\' or `thingummybob\\', as in `where\\'s that clever\nwidget that undoes the foil and takes out the cork in one go\\'. Zsh\\'s\nuse has always seemed to me closer to the second, non-technical version,\nbut I may be biased by the fact that the internal object introduced by\nZefram to represent a widget, and never seen by the user, is called a\n`thingy\\', which I won\\'t refer to again since you don\\'t need to know.\nAnyway, a `widget\\' is essentially what I\\'ve been calling an editor\ncommand up to now, something you can bind to a key sequence. The reason\nthe more precise terminology is useful is that as soon as you have shell\nfunctions flying around, the word `command\\' is hopelessly\nnon-specific, since functions are full of commands which may or may not\nbe widgets. So I make no apology for using the word.\nSo now we are introducing a second type of widget: one which, instead of\nsomething handled by code built into the shell, is handled by a function\nwritten by the user. They are completely equivalent; bindkey and\ncompany don\\'t care which it is. All you need to do to create a widget\nis\n  zle -N widget-name function-name\nthen widget-name can be used in bindkey, or execute-named-cmd, and\nthe function function-name will be run. If the widget-name and\nfunction-name are the same, which is often the simplest thing to do,\nyou just need one of them.\nYou can list the existing widgets by using `zle -l\\', although often\n`zle -lL\\' is a better choice since the output format is then the\nsame as the form you would use to define the widget. If you see lots of\n`zle -C\\' widgets when you do that, ignore them for now; they are\ncompletion widgets, handled a bit differently and described in chapter\n6.\nNow you need to know what should go into the function.\n[]{#l105}\n4.7.2: Executing other widgets\nThe simplest thing you can do inside a function implementing a widget is\ncall an existing function. So,\n  my-widget() {\n    zle backward-word\n  }\n  zle -N my-widget\ncreates a widget called my-widget which behaves in every respect\n(except speed) like the builtin widget backward-word. You can even\ngive it a prefix argument, which is passed down; \\e3 then whatever you\nbound the widget to (or \\exmy-widget) will go backward three words.\nSuppose you wanted to pass your own prefix argument to backward-word,\ninstead of what the user typed? Or suppose you want to take account of\nthe prefix argument, but do something different with it? Both are\npossible.\nLet\\'s take the first of those. You can supply a prefix argument for\nthis command alone by putting -n argument after the widget name\n(note this is not where most options go).\n  my-widget() {\n    zle backward-word -n 2\n  }\nThis always goes backwards two words, overriding any numeric argument\ngiven by the user. (You can redefine the function without telling zle\nabout it, by the way; zle just calls whatever function happens to be\ndefined when the widget is run.) If you put just -N after the name\ninstead, it will cancel out any prefix given by the user, without\nintroducing a new one.\nThe other part of prefix handling --- intercepting the one the user\nspecified and maybe modifying it --- introduces one of the most\nimportant parts of user-defined widgets. Zle provides various parameters\nwhich can be read and often written to alter the behaviour of the editor\nor even the text being edited. In this case, the parameter is $PREFIX.\nFor example,\n  my-widget() {\n    zle backward-word -n $(( ${NUMERIC:-1} * 2 ))\n  }\nThis uses an arithmetic substitution to provide an argument to\nbackward-word which is twice what the user gave. Note that\n${NUMERIC:-1} notation, which is important: most of the time, you\ndon\\'t give a numeric argument to a command at all, and in that case zle\nnaturally enough treats $NUMERIC as if it wasn\\'t set. This would mess\nup the arithmetic substitution.\nBy the way, if you do make an error in a shell function, you won\\'t see\nit; you\\'ll just get a beep, unless you\\'ve turned that off with\nsetopt nobeep. The output from such functions is junked, since it\nwould mess up the display. So you should do any basic debugging before\nturning the function into a widget, for example, stick a print in\nfront and run it directly --- you can\\'t execute widgets from outside\nthe editor.\nThe following also works:\n  my-widget() {\n    (( NUMERIC = ${NUMERIC:-1} * 2 ))\n    zle backward-word\n  }\nbecause you can alter $NUMERIC directly, and unless overridden by the\n-n argument it is used by any widgets called from the function. If you\ncalled more widgets inside the function --- and you can call as many\nas you like --- the same argument would apply to all the ones that\ndidn\\'t have an explicit -n or -N.\nSome widgets allow you to specify non-numeric arguments. At the moment\nthese are mainly search functions, which you can give an explicit search\nstring. Usually, however, you want to specify a new search string each\ntime. The most useful way of using this I can see is to provide an\ninitial argument for incremental search commands. Later, I\\'ll show you\nhow you can read in characters in a similar fashion to Emacs mode\\'s\n^r binding, history-incremental-search-backwards.\n[]{#l106}\n4.7.3: Some special builtin widgets and their uses\nThere are some things you might want to do with the editor in a zle\nfunction which wouldn\\'t be useful executed directly from zle. One is to\ncause an error in the same way as a normal widget does. You can do that\nwith `zle beep\\'. However, this doesn\\'t automatically stop your\nfunction at that point; it\\'s up to you to return from it.\nIt\\'s possible to redefine a builtin widget just by declaring it with\n`zle -N\\' and defining the corresponding function. From now on, all\nexisting bindings which refer to that widget will cause yours to be run\ninstead of the builtin one. This happens because zle doesn\\'t actually\ncare what a widget does until it is run. You can see this by using\nbindkey to define a key sequence to call an undefined widget such as\nany-old-string. The shell doesn\\'t complain until you actually hit the\nkey sequence.\nSometimes, however, you want to be sure to call the builtin widget, even\nif the behaviour has been redefined. You can do this by putting a\n`.\\' in front of the name of the widget;\n`zle .up-line-or-history\\' always calls the builtin widget usually\nreferred to as up-line-or-history, even if the latter has been\nredefined. One use for this is to rebind `accept-line\\' to do\nsomething whenever zle is about to pass a line up to the shell, but to\naccept the line anyway: you write your own widget accept-line, make\nsure it calls `zle .accept-line just before it finishes, and then use\n`zle -N accept-line. Here\\'s a trivial but not entirely stupid\nexample:\n  accept-line() {\n    print -n \"\\e]2;Executing $BUFFER\\a\"\n    zle .accept-line\n  }\n  zle -N accept-line\nNow every time you hit return to execute a command, that print command\nwill be executed first. As written, it puts `Executing\\' and then the\ncontents of the command line (see below) into the title of your xterm\nwindow, assuming it understands the usual xterm escape sequences. In\nfact, this particular example is usually handled with the special shell\nfunction (not zle function) `preexec\\' which is passed a command line\nabout to be executed as an argument instead of in $BUFFER. There seems\nto be a side effect of rebinding accept-line that the return key stops\nworking in the minibuffer under some circumstances.\nNote that to undo the fact that return executes your new widget, you\nneed to alias accept-line back to .accept-line:\n  zle -A .accept-line accept-line\nIf you have trouble remembering the order, as with most alias or rename\ncommands in zsh and UNIX generally, including ln and bindkey -A, the\nexisting command, the one whose properties you want to keep, comes\nfirst, while the new name for it comes second. Also, as with those\ncommands, it doesn\\'t matter if the second name on the line currently\nmeans something else; that will be replaced by the new meaning.\nAfterwards, you don\\'t need to worry about your own accept-line\nwidget; zle handles the details of removing widgets when they\\'re no\nlonger referred to. The function\\'s still there, however, since as far\nas the rest of the shell is concerned it\\'s just an ordinary shell\nfunction which you need to `unfunction\\' to remove.\nDo remember, however, not to delete a widget which redefines a basic\ninternal widget by the obvious command\n  # Noooo!\n  zle -D accept-line\nwhich stops the return key having any effect other than complaining\nthere\\'s no such widget. If you get into real trouble,\n`\\ex.accept-line\\' should work, as you can use the `.\\'-widgets\nanywhere you can use any other except where they would redefine or\ndelete a `.\\' widget. Use the `zle -A\\' command above with the\nextended-command form of `.accept-line\\' to return to normality. If\nyou try to redefine or delete a `.\\' widget, zle will tell you it\\'s\nprotected. You can remove any other widget in this way, however, even if\nit is still bound to a key sequence; you will then see an error if you\ntype that sequence.\nOne point to note about accept-line is that the line isn\\'t passed up\nto zsh instantly, only when your own function exits. This is pretty\nobvious when you think about it; zle is called from the main shell, and\nif your own zle widget hasn\\'t finished executing, the main shell\nhasn\\'t got control back yet. But it does mean, for example, that if you\nmodify the command line after a call to accept-line or .accept-line,\nthose changes are reflected in the line passed up to the shell:\n  # Noooo! to this one too.\n  accept-line() {\n    zle .accept-line\n    BUFFER='Ha ha!'\n  }\nThis always returns the string `Ha ha!\\' to the main shell. This is\nnot particularly useful unless you are constructing a Samuel Beckett\nshell for display at an installation in a Parisian art gallery.\n[]{#l107}\n4.7.4: Special parameters: normal text\nThe shell makes various parameters available for easy manipulation of\nthe command line. You\\'ve already seen $NUMERIC. You may wonder what\nhappens if you have your own parmeter called $NUMERIC; after all,\nit\\'s a fairly simple string to use as a name. The good news is you\ndon\\'t need to worry; when the shell runs a zle function, it simply\nhides any existing occurrences of a parameter and makes its special\nparameters available. Then when it exits, the original parameter is\nreenabled. So all you have to worry about is making sure you don\\'t use\nthese special parameters for anything else while you are inside a zle\nwidget.\nThere are four particularly common zle parameters.\nFirst, there are three ways of referring to the text on the command\nline: $BUFFER is the entire line as a string, $LBUFFER is the line\nleft of the cursor position, and $RBUFFER is the line after it\nincluding the character under the cursor, so that the division is always\nat the point where the next inserted character would go. Any or all of\nthese may be empty, and $BUFFER is always the string\n$LBUFFER$RBUFFER.\nThe necessary counterpart to these is $CURSOR, which is the cursor\nposition with 1 being the first character. If you know how the shell\nhandles substrings in parameter substitutions, you will be able to see\nthat $LBUFFER is $BUFFER[1,$CURSOR-1], while $RBUFFER is\n$BUFFER[$CURSOR,-1] (unless you are using the option KSH_ARRAYS for\ncompatibility of indexes with ksh --- this isn\\'t recommended for\nimplementing zle or completion widgets as it causes confusion with the\nones supplied with the shell).\nThe really useful thing about these is that they are modifiable. If you\nmodify $LBUFFER or $RBUFFER, then $BUFFER and $CURSOR will be\nmodified appropriately; lengthening or shortening $LBUFFER increases\nor decreases $CURSOR. If you modify $BUFFER, you may need to set\n$CURSOR yourself as the shell can\\'t tell for sure where the cursor\nshould be. If you alter $CURSOR, characters will be moved between\n$LBUFFER and $RBUFFER, but $BUFFER will remain the same.\nThis makes tasks along the lines of basic movement and deletion commands\nextremely simple, often just a matter of pattern matching. However, it\ndefinitely pays to know about zsh\\'s more sophisticated pattern matching\nand parameter substitution features, described in the next chapter. For\nexample, if you start a widget function with\n  emulate -L zsh\n  setopt extendedglob\n  LBUFFER=${LBUFFER%%[^[:blank:]]##}\nthen $LBUFFER contains the line left of the cursor stripped of all the\nnon-blank characters (usually anything except space or tab) immediately\nto the left of the cursor.\nThis function uses the parameter substitution feature\n`${param%%pattern}\\' which removes the longest match of\npattern from the end of $param. The `emulate -L zsh\\' ensures\nthe shell options are set appropriately for the function and makes all\noption settings local, and `setopt extendedglob\\' which turns on the\nextended pattern matching features; it is this that makes the sequence\n`##\\' appearing in the pattern mean `at least one repetition of the\nprevious pattern element\\'. The previous pattern element is `anything\nexcept a blank character\\'. Hence, all occurrences of non-blank\ncharacters are removed from the end of $LBUFFER.\nIf you want to move the cursor over those characters, you can tweak the\nfunction slightly:\n  emulate -L zsh\n  setopt extendedglob\n  chars=${(M)LBUFFER%%[^[:blank:]]##}\n  (( CURSOR -= ${#chars} ))\nThe string `(M)\\' has appeared at the start of the parameter\nsubstitution. This is part of zsh\\'s unique system of parameter flags;\nthis one means `insert the matched portion of the substitution\\'. In\nother words, instead of returning $LBUFFER stripped of non-blank\ncharacters at the end, the substitution returns those very characters\nwhich it would have stripped. To skip over them is now a simple matter\nof decreasing $CURSOR by the length of that string.\nYou\\'ll find if you try these examples that they probably don\\'t do\nquite what you want. In particular, they don\\'t handle any blank\ncharacters found next to the non-blank ones which normal word-orientated\nfunctions do. However, you now have enough information to add tests for\nthat yourself.\nIf you get more sophisticated, you can then add handling for $NUMERIC.\nRemember this isn\\'t set unless the user gave it explicitly, so it\\'s up\nto you to treat it as 1 in that case.\n[]{#l108}\n4.7.5: Other special parameters\nA large fraction of what you are likely to want to do can be done with\nthe parameters we\\'ve already met. Here are some hints as to how you\nmight want to use some of the other parameters available. As always, for\na complete list with rather less in the way of hints see the manual.\n$KEYS tells you the keys which were used to call the widget; it\\'s a\nstring of those raw characters, not turned into the bindkey format. In\nother words, if it was a single key (including possibly a control key or\na meta key), $KEYS will just contain a single character. So you can\nchange the widget\\'s behaviour for different keys. Here\\'s a very (very)\nsimple function like self-insert:\n  LBUFFER=$LBUFFER$KEYS\nNote this doesn\\'t work very well with \\ex extended command handling;\nyou just get the ^m from the end of the line. You need to make sure\nany widgets which use $KEYS are sensibly bound. This also doesn\\'t\nhandle numeric arguments to repeat characters; it\\'s a fairly simple\nexercise (particularly given zsh\\'s `repeat\\' loop) to add that.\n$WIDGET and $LASTWIDGET tell you the name of the current widget\nbeing executed and the one before that. These don\\'t sound all that\nuseful at first hearing. However, you can use $WIDGET together with\nthe fact that a widget doesn\\'t need to have the same name as the\nfunction that defines it. You can define\n  zle -N this-widget function\n  zle -N that-widget function\nand test $WIDGET inside function to see if it contains this-widget\nor that-widget. If these have a lot of shared code, that is a\nconsiderable simplification without having to write extra functions.\n$LASTWIDGET tends to be used for a slightly different purpose:\nchecking whether the last command to be executed was the same as the\ncurrent one, or maybe was just friendly with it. Here are edited\nhighlights of the function up-line-or-beginning-search, a sort of\ncross between up-line-or-search and\nhistory-beginning-search-backward which has been added to the shell\ndistribution for 4.1. If there are previous lines in the buffer, it\nmoves up through them; else if it\\'s the first in a sequence of calls to\nthis function it remembers the cursor position and looks backwards for a\nline with the same text from the start up to that point, and puts the\ncursor at the end of the line; else if the same widget has just been\nexecuted, it uses the old cursor position to search for another match\nfurther back in the history.\n  if [[ $LBUFFER == *$'\\n'* ]]; then\n    zle .up-line-or-history\n    __searching=''\n  else\n    if [[ $LASTWIDGET = $__searching ]]; then\n      CURSOR=$__savecursor\n    else\n      __savecursor=$CURSOR\n    fi\n    __searching=$WIDGET\n    zle .history-beginning-search-backward\n    zle .end-of-line\n  fi\nWe test $__searching instead of $WIDGET directly to be able to tell\nthe case when we are moving lines instead of searching. $__savecursor\ngives the position for the backward search, after which we put the\ncursor at the end of the line. The parameters beginning `__\\' aren\\'t\nlocal to the function, because we need to test them from the previous\nexecution, so they have been given underscores in front to try to\ndistinguish them from other parameters which might be around.\nYou\\'ll see that the actual function supplied in the distribution is a\nlittle more complicated than this; for one thing, it uses styles set by\nthe user to decide it\\'s behaviour. Styles are described for use with\ncompletion widgets in chapter 6, but you can use\nthem exactly the same way in zle functions.\nThe full version of up-line-or-beginning-search uses another\nparameter, $PREBUFFER. This contains any text already absorbed by\nzle which you can no longer edit --- in other words, text read in\nbefore the shell prompted with $PS2 for the remainder. Testing\n`[[ -n $PREBUFFER ]]\\' therefore effectively tests whether you are at\nthe $PS2. You can use this to implement behaviour after the fashion of\npush-line-or-edit.\n[]{#l109}\n4.7.6: Reading keys and using the minibuffer\nEvery now and then you want the editor to do a sequence of operations\nwith user input in the middle. This is usually done by a combination of\ntwo commands.\nFirst, you may need to prompt the user in the minibuffer, just like\n\\ex does. You can do this with `zle -R\\'. Its basic function is to\nredisplay the command line, flushing all the changes you have made in\nyour function so far, but you can give it a string argument which\nappears in the minibuffer, just below the command line. You can give it\na list of other strings after that, which appear in a similar way to\nlists of possible completions, but have no special significance to zle\nin this case.\nTo get input back from the user, you can use `read -k\\' which reads a\nsingle key (not a sequence; no lookup takes place). This command is\nalways available in the shell, but in this case it is handled by zle\nitself. The key is returned as a raw byte. Two facilities of arithmetic\nevaluation are useful for handling this key: `#key\\' returns the\nASCII code for the first character of $key, while `##key\\'\nreturns the ASCII code for key, which is in the form that bindkey\nwould understand. For example,\n  read -k key\n  if (( #key == ##\\C-g )); then\n     ...\nmakes the use of arithmetic evaluation. The form on the left turns the\nfirst character in $key into a number, the second turns the literal\nbindkey-style string \\C-g into a number (ASCII 7, since 1 to 26 are\njust \\C-a to \\C-z). Don\\'t confuse either of these forms with\n`$#key\\', which is the length of the string in the parameter, in this\ncase almost certainly 1 for a single byte; this form works both inside\nand outside arithmetic substitution, the other forms only inside. The\n`(( ... ))\\' form is recommended for arithmetic substitutions\nwhenever possibly; you can do it with the basic `[[ ... ]]\\' form,\nsince `-eq\\' and similar tests treat both sides as arithmetic, though\nyou may need extra quoting; however, the only good reason I know for\ndoing that is to avoid using two types of condition syntax in the same\ncomplex test.\nThese tricks are only really useful for quite complicated functions. For\nan example, look at the function incremental-complete-word supplied\nwith the zsh source distribution. This function doesn\\'t add to clarity\nby using the form `#\\\\C-g\\' instead of `##\\C-g\\'; it does the same\nthing but the double backslash is very confusing, which is why the other\nform was introduced.\n[]{#l110}\n4.7.7: Examples\ntranspose-words-about-point\\\nThis function is a variant on transpose-words. It has various twists.\nFirst, the words in question are always space-delimited, neither shell\nwords nor words in the $WORDCHARS sense. This makes it fairly\npredictable.\nSecond, it will transpose words about the current point (hence its name)\neven if the character under the cursor is not a whitespace character. I\nfind this useful because I am eternally typing compound words a bit like\n`function_name\\' only to find that what I should have typed was\n`name_function\\'. Now I just position the cursor over the underscore\nand execute this widget.\n  emulate -L zsh\n  setopt extendedglob\n\n  local match mbegin mend pat1 pat2 word1 word2 ws1 ws2\n\n  pat1=${LBUFFER%%(#b)([^[:blank:]]##)([[:blank:]]#)}\n  word1=$match[1]\n  ws1=$match[2]\n\n  match=()\n  pat2=${RBUFFER##(#b)(?[[:blank:]]#)([^[:blank:]]##)}\n  ws2=$match[1]\n  word2=$match[2]\n\n  if [[ -n $word1 && -n $word2 ]]; then\n    LBUFFER=\"$pat1$word2$ws1\"\n    RBUFFER=\"$ws2$word1$pat2\"\n  else\n    zle beep\n  fi\nThe only clever stuff here is the pattern matching. It makes a great\ndeal of use of `backreferences\\' an extended globbing feature which is\nused in all forms of pattern matching including, as in this case,\nparameter substitution. It will be described fully in the next chapter.\nThe key things to look for are the `(#b)\\', which activates\nbackreferences if the option EXTENDED_GLOB is turned on, the\nparentheses following that, which mark out the bits you want to refer\nto, and the references to elements of the array $match, which store\nthose bits. The shell also sets $mbegin and $mend to give the\npositions of the start and end of those matches, which is why those\nparameters are made local; we want to preserve them from being seen\noutside the function even though we don\\'t actually use them.\nYou might also need to know about the `#\\' characters: one after a\npattern means `zero or more repetitions\\', and two mean `one or more\nrepetitions\\'. Finally, `[:blank:]\\' in a character class refers to\nany blank character; when negated, as in the character class\n`[^[:blank:]]\\', it means any non-blank character. With the `#\\'s\nwe match a series blank or non-blank characters. Given that, you can\nwork out the rest of what\\'s going on.\nHere\\'s a more sophisticated version of that. If you found the previous\none heavy going. you probably don\\'t want to look too closely at this.\n  emulate -L zsh\n  setopt extendedglob\n\n  local wordstyle blankpat wordpat1 wordpat2\n  local match mbegin mend pat1 pat2 word1 word2 ws1 ws2\n\n  zstyle -s ':zle:transpose-words-about-point' word-style wordstyle\n\n  case $wordstyle in\n    (shell) local bufwords\n            # This splits the line into words as the shell understands them.\n            bufwords=(${(z)LBUFFER})\n            wordpat1=\"${(q)bufwords[-1]}\"\n            # Take substring of RBUFFER to skip over first character,\n            # which is the one under the cursor.\n            bufwords=(${(z)RBUFFER[2,-1]})\n            wordpat2=\"${(q)bufwords[1]}\"\n            blankpat='[[:blank:]]#'\n            ;;\n    (space) blankpat='[[:blank:]]#'\n            wordpat1='[^[:blank:]]##'\n            wordpat2=$wordpat1\n            ;;\n    (*) local wc=$WORDCHARS\n        if [[ $wc = (#b)(?*)-(*) ]]; then\n          # We need to bring any `-' to the front to avoid confusing\n          # character classes... we get away with `]' since in zsh\n          # this isn't a pattern character if it's quoted.\n          wc=-$match[1]$match[2]\n        fi\n        # A blank is anything not in the character class consisting\n        # of alphanumerics and the characters in $wc.\n        # Quote $wc where necessary, because we don't want those\n        # characters to be considered as pattern characters later on.\n        blankpat=\"[^${(q)wc}a-zA-Z0-9]#\"\n        # and a word character is anything else.\n        wordpat1=\"[${(q)wc}a-zA-Z0-9]##\"\n        wordpat2=$wordpat1\n        ;;\n  esac\n\n  # The eval makes any special characters in the parameters active.\n  # In particular, we need the surrounding `[' s to be `real'.\n  # This is why we quoted the wordpats in the `shell' option, where\n  # they have to be treated as literal strings at this point.\n  eval pat1='${LBUFFER%%(#b)('${wordpat1}')('${blankpat}')}'\n  word1=$match[1]\n  ws1=$match[2]\n\n  match=()\n  eval pat2='${RBUFFER##(#b)(?'${blankpat}')('${wordpat2}')}'\n  ws2=$match[1]\n  word2=$match[2]\n\n  if [[ -n $word1 && -n $word2 ]]; then\n    LBUFFER=\"$pat1$word2$ws1\"\n    RBUFFER=\"$ws2$word1$pat2\"\n  else\n    zle beep\n  fi\nWhat has been added is the ability to use a style to define how the\nshell finds a `word\\'. By default, words are the same as what the shell\nusually thinks of as a word; this is handled by the branch of the case\nstatement which uses `$WORDCHARS\\' and a little extra trickery to get\na pattern which matches the set of characters considered parts of a\nword. We used the eval\\'s because it allowed us to have some bits of\n$wordpat1 and friends active as pattern characters while others were\nquoted.\nThis introduces two types of parameter expansion flags:\n${(q)param} adds backslashes to quote special characters in\n$param, so that when the parameter appears after eval the result\nis just the original string. ${(z)param} splits the parameter just\nas if it were a shell command line being split into a command and words,\nso the result is an array; `z\\' stands for zsh-splitting or just\nzplitting as you fancy.\nIf you set\n  zstyle ':zle:*' word-style space\nyou get back to the behaviour of the original function.\nFinally, if you replace `space\\' with `shell\\' in that zstyle\ncommand, you will get words as they are split for normal use within the\nshell; for example try\n  echo execute the widget 'between these' 'two quoted expressions'\nand the entire quoted expressions will be transposed. You may find that\nif you do this in the middle of a quoted expression, you don\\'t get a\nsensible result; that\\'s because the (z)-splitting doesn\\'t know what\nto do with the improperly completed quotes to its left and right. Some\nversions of the shell have a bug (fixed in 4.0.5) that the expressions\nwhich couldn\\'t be split properly, because the quotes weren\\'t complete,\nhave an extra space character at the end.\ninsert-numeric\\\nHere\\'s a widget which allows you to insert an ASCII character which you\nknow by number. I can\\'t for the life of me remember where it came from,\nbut it\\'s been lying around apparently for two and a half years (please\ndo email me if you think you wrote it, otherwise I\\'ll assume I did).\nYou can give it a numeric prefix (that\\'s the easy part of the\nfunction), else it will prompt you for a number. If you type `x\\' or\n`o\\' the number is treated as hexadecimal or octal, respectively,\nelse as decimal.\n  # Set up standard options.\n  # Important for portability.\n  emulate -L zsh\n\n  # x must display in hexadecimal\n  typeset -i 16 x\n\n  if (( ${+NUMERIC} )); then\n    # Numeric prefix given; just use that.\n    x=$NUMERIC\n  else\n    # We need to read the ASCII code.\n    local msg modes key mode=dec code char\n    # Prompt for and read a base.\n    integer base=10\n    zle -R \"ASCII code (o -> oct, x -> hex) [$mode]: \"\n    read -k key\n    case $key in\n      (o) base=8 mode=oct\n          zle -R \"ASCII code [$mode]: \"\n          read -k key\n          ;;\n      (x) base=16 mode=hex\n          zle -R \"ASCII code [$mode]: \"\n          read -k key\n         ;;\n    esac\n    # Now we are looking for numbers in that base.\n    # Loop until newline or return.\n    while [[ '#key' -ne '##\\n' && '#key' -ne '##\\r' ]]; do\n      if [[ '#key' -eq '##^?' || '#key' -eq '##^h' ]]; then\n        # Delete a character\n        [[ -n $code ]] && code=${code[1,-2]}\n      elif [[ ($mode == hex && $key != [0-9a-fA-f]) ||\n            ($mode == dec && $key != [0-9]) ||\n            ($mode == oct && $key != [0-7]) ]]; then\n        # Character not in range, beep\n        zle beep\n      elif [[ '#key' -eq '##\\C-g' ]]; then\n        # Abort: returning 1 signals to zle that this\n        # is an abnormal termination.\n        return 1\n      else\n        code=\"${code}${key}\"\n      fi\n      char=\n      if [[ -n $code ]]; then\n        # Work out the character using the\n        # numbers typed so far.\n        (( x = ${base}#${code} ))\n        if (( x > 255 )); then\n          zle beep\n          code=${code[1,-2]}\n          [[ -n $code ]] && (( x = ${base}#${code} ))\n        fi\n        [[ -n $code ]] && eval char=\\$\\'\\\\x${x##???}\\'\n      fi\n\n      # Prompt for any more digits, showing\n      # the character as it would be inserted.\n      zle -R \"ASCII code [$mode]: $code${char:+ = $char}\"\n      read -k key || return 1\n    done\n    # If aborted with no code, return\n    [[ -z $code ]] && return 0\n    # Now we have the ASCII code.\n    (( x = ${base}#${code} ))\n  fi\n\n  # Finally, if we have a single-byte character,\n  # insert it to the left of the cursor\n  if (( x  255 )); then\n    return 1\n  else\n    eval LBUFFER=\\$LBUFFER\\$\\'\\\\x${x##???}\\'\n  fi\nThis shows how to do interactive input. The `zle -R\\'s prompt the\nuser, while the `read -k\\'s accept a character at a time. As an extra\nfeature, while you are typing the number, the character that would be\ninserted if you hit return is shown. The widget also handles deletion\nwith backspace or the (UNIX-style, not PC-style) delete key.\nOne blight on this is the way of turning the number in x into a\ncharacter, which is done by all those evals and backslashes. It uses\nthe feature that e.g. $'\\x41' is the character 0x41 (an ASCII\n`A\\'). To use this, we must make sure the character (stored in x)\nappears as hexadecimal, and following ksh zsh outputs hexadecimal\nnumbers as `16#41\\' or similar. (The new option C_BASES shows\nhexadecimal numbers as 0x41 and similar, but here we need the plain\nnumber in any case.) Hence we strip the `16#\\' and construct our\n$'\\x41'. Now we need to persuade the shell to interpret this as a\nquoted string by passing it to eval with the special characters ($,\n\\, ') quoted with a backslash so that they aren\\'t interpreted too\nearly.\nBy the way, note that zsh only handles ordinary 8-bit characters at the\nmoment. It doesn\\'t matter if some do-gooder on your system has set\nthings up to use UTF-8 (a UNIX-friendly version of the international\nstandard for multi-byte characters, Unicode) to appeal to the\ninternational market, I\\'m afraid zsh is stuck with ISO 8859 and similar\ncharacter sets for now.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide05.html":{"url":"zshguide05.html","title":"章节 5","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n[]{#subst}[]{#l111}\nChapter 5: Substitutions\nThis chapter will appeal above all to people who are excited by the fact\nthat\n  print ${array[(r)${(l.${#${(O@)array//?/X}[1]}..?.)}]}\nprints out the longest element of the array $array.

It\\'s about time I did, since using quotes\nis an important part of controlling the effects of the shell\\'s various\nsubstitutions. Here are the basic quoting types.\n[]{#l113}\n5.1.1: Backslashes\nThe main point to make about backslashes is that they are really\ntrivial. You can quote any character whatsoever from the shell with a\nbackslash, even if it didn\\'t mean anything unquoted; so if the worst\ncomes to the worst, you can take any old string at all, whatever it has\nin it --- random collections of quotes, backslashes, unprintable\ncharacters --- quote every single character with a backslash, and the\nshell will treat it as a plain string:\n  print \\T\\h\\i\\s\\ \\i\\s\\ \\*\\p\\o\\i\\n\\t\\l\\e\\s\\s\\*\\ \\ \n      \\-\\ \\b\\u\\t\\ \\v\\a\\l\\i\\d\\!\nRemember, too that, this means you need an extra layer of quotation to\npass a `\\n\\', or whatever, down to print.\nHowever, zsh has an easier way of making sure everything is quoted with\na backslash when that\\'s needed. It\\'s a special form of parameter\nsubstitution, just one of many tricks you can do by supplying flags in\nparentheses:\n  % read string\n  This is a *string* with various `special' characters\n  % print -r -- ${(q)string}\n  This\\ is\\ a\\ \\*string\\*\\ with\\ various\\ \\`special\\'\\ characters\nThe read builtin didn\\'t do anything to what you typed, so $string\ncontains just those characters. The -r flag to print told it to print\nout what came after it in raw fashion, and here\\'s the special part:\n${(q)string} tells the shell to output the parameter with backslashes\nwhere needed to prevent special characters being interpreted. All\nparameter flags are specific to zsh; no other shell has them.\nThe flag is not very useful there, because zsh usually (remember the\nGLOB_SUBST option?) doesn\\'t do anything special to characters from\nsubstitutions anyway. Where it is extremely useful is if you are going\nto re-evaluate the text in the substitution but still want it treated as\na plain string. So after the above,\n  % eval print -r -- ${(q)string}\n  This is a *string* with various `special' characters\nand you get back what you started with, because at the eval of the\ncommand line the backslashes put in by the (q) flag meant that the\nvalue was treated as a plain string.\nYou can strip off quotes in parameters, too; the flag (Q) does this.\nIt doesn\\'t care whether backslashes or single or double quotes are\nused, it treats them all the way the shell\\'s parser would. You only\nneed this when the parameter has somehow acquired quotes in its value.\nOne way this can happen is if you try reading a file containing shell\ncommands, and for this there\\'s another trick: the (z) flag splits a\nline into an array in the same way as if the line had been read in and\nwas, say, being assigned to an array. Here\\'s an example:\n  % cat file\n  print 'a quoted string' and\\ another\\ argument\n  % read -r line  print -r \"quoted:    $word\"\n  for> print -r \"unquoted:  ${(Q)word}\"\n  for> done\n  quoted:    print\n  unquoted:  print\n  quoted:    'a quoted string'\n  unquoted:  a quoted string\n  quoted:    and\\ another\\ argument\n  unquoted:  and another argument\nYou will notice that the (z) doesn\\'t remove any of the quotes from\nthe words read in, but the (Q) flag does. Note the -r flags to both\nread and print: the first prevents the backslashes being absorbed by\nread, and the second prevents them being absorbed by print. I\\'m\nafraid backslashes can be a bit of a pain in the neck.\n[]{#l114}\n5.1.2: Single quotes\nThe only thing you can\\'t quote with single quotes is another single\nquote. However, there\\'s an option RC_QUOTES, where two single quotes\ninside a single-quoted string are turned into one. Apparently `RC\\'\nrefers to the shell rc which appeared in plan9; it seems to be one of\nthose programmes that some people get fanatically worked up about while\nthe rest of us can\\'t quite work out why. Zsh users may sympathise.\n(This was corrected by Oliver Kiddle and Bart Schaefer after I guessed\nincorrectly that RC stood for recursive, although you\\'re welcome to\nthink of it that way anyway. It doesn\\'t really work for\nRC_EXPAND_PARAM, however, which is definitely from the rc shell, and\nif you look at the source code you will find a variable called\n`plan9\\' which is tested to see if that option is in effect.)\nYou might remember something like this from BASIC, although in that case\nwith double quotes --- in zsh, it works only with single quotes, for\nsome reason. So,\n  print -r 'A ''quoted'' string'\nwould usually give you the output `A quoted string\\', but with the\noption set it prints `A 'quoted' string\\'. The -r option to print\ndoesn\\'t do anything here, it\\'s just to show I\\'m not hiding anything.\nThis is usually a useful and harmless option to have set, since there\\'s\nno other good reason for having two quotes together within quotes.\nThe standard way of quoting single quotes is to end the quote, insert a\nbackslashed single quote, and restart quotes again:\n  print -r 'A '\\''quoted'\\'' string'\nwhich is unaffected by the option setting, since the quotes immediately\nafter the backslashes are always treated as an ordinary printable\ncharacter. What you can\\'t ever do is use backslashes as a way of\nquoting characters inside single quotes; they are just treated as\nordinary characters there.\nYou can make parameter flags produce strings quoted with single quotes\ninstead of backslashes by doubling the `q\\': `${(qq)param}\\'\ninstead of `${(q)param}\\'. The main use for this is that the result\nis shorter if you know there are a lot of special characters in the\nstring, and it\\'s also a bit more easy to read for humans rather than\nmachines, but usually it gains nothing over the other form. It can tell\nwhether you have RC_QUOTES set and uses that to make the string even\nshorter, so be careful if you might use the resulting string somewhere\nwhere the option isn\\'t set.\n[]{#l115}\n5.1.3: POSIX quotes\nThere\\'s a relative of single quotes which uses the syntax $' to\nintroduce a quoted string and ' to end it; I refer to them as `POSIX\nquotes\\' because they appear in the POSIX standard and I don\\'t know\nwhat else to call them; `string quotes\\' is one possibility, but sounds\na bit vague (what else would you quote?) The difference from single\nquotes is that they understand the same backslash sequences as the print\nbuiltin. Hence you can have the convenience of using `\\n\\' for\nnewline, `\\e\\' for escape, `\\xFF\\' for an arbitrary character in\nhexadecimal, and so on, for any command:\n  % cat Remember the `here string\\' notation `\\', which supplies standard\ninput for the command. Hence the output shows exactly how the quoted\nstring is being interpreted. It is the same as\n  % print 'Line\\tone\\n\\Line\\ttwo'\n  Line    one\n  Line    two\nbut there the interpretation is done inside print, which isn\\'t always\nconvenient. POSIX quotes are currently rather underused.\nThis is as good a point as any to mention that the shell is completely\n`eight-bit clean\\', which means you can have any of the 256 possible\ncharacters anywhere in your string. For example, $'foo\\000bar' has an\nembedded ASCII NUL in it (that\\'s not a misprint --- officially, ASCII\nnon-printing characters have two- or three-letter abbreviations).\nUsually this terminates a string, but the shell works around this when\nyou are using it internally; when you try and pass it as an argument to\nan external programme, however, all bets are off. Almost certainly the\nfirst NUL in that case will cause the programme to think the string is\nfinished, because no information about the length of arguments is passed\ndown and there\\'s nothing the shell can do about it. Hence, for example:\n  % echo $'foo\\000bar'\n  foobar\n  % /bin/echo $'foo\\000bar'\n  foo\nThe shell\\'s echo knows about the shell\\'s 8-bit conventions, and\nprints out the NUL, which the terminal doesn\\'t show, then the remainder\nof the string. The external version of echo didn\\'t know any better\nthan to stop when it reached the NUL.\nThere are actually uses for embedded NULs: some versions of find and\nxargs, for example, will put or accept NULs instead of newlines\nbetween their bits of input and output (as distinct from command line\narguments), which is much safer if there\\'s a chance the input or output\ncan contain a live newline. Using $'\\000' allows the shell to fit in\nvery comfortably with these. If you want to try this, the corresponding\noptions are -print0 for find (print with a NUL terminator instead of\nnewline) and -0 for xargs (read input assuming a NUL terminator).\nIn older versions of the shell, characters with the top bit set, such as\nthose from non-English character sets found in ISO 8859 fonts, could\ncause problems, since the shell also uses such characters internally to\nrepresent its own special characters, but recent versions of the shell\n(from about 3.0) side-step this problem in the same way as for NULs. Any\nremaining problems --- it\\'s quite tricky to handle this completely\nconsistently --- are bugs and should be reported.\nYou can force parameters to be quoted with POSIX quotes by the somewhat\nabsurd expedient of making the q in the quote flag appear a total of\nfour times. I can\\'t think why you would ever want to do that, except\nthat it will turn newlines into `\\n\\' and hence the result will fit\non a single (maybe rather long) line. Plus you get the replacement of\nfunny characters with escape sequences.\n[]{#l116}\n5.1.4: Double quotes\nDouble quotes allow some, but not all, forms of substitution inside.\nMore specifically, they allow parameter expansion, command substitution\nand arithmetic substitution, but not any of the others: process\nsubstitution doesn\\'t happen, braces and initial tildes and equals signs\nare not expanded and patterns are not special. Here\\'s a table; each\nexpression on the left is some command line argument, and the results\nshow what is substituted if it appears outside quotes, or in double\nquotes.\n  Expression      Outside quotes  In double quotes\n  ------------------------------------------------\n  =(echo hi mum)  /tmp/zshTiqpL     =(echo hi mum)\n  $ZSH_VERSION    4.0.1             4.0.1\n  $(echo hi mum)  hi mum            hi mum\n  $((6**2 + 6))   42                42\n  {a,b}cd         acd bcd           {a,b}cd\n  ~/foo           /home/pws/foo     ~/foo\n  .zl*            .zlogin .zlogout  .zl*\nThat `/tmp/zshTiqpL\\' could be any temporary filename, and indeed\nseveral of the other substitutions will be different in your case.\nYou might already have guessed that `${(qqq)string}\\' forces\n$string to use double quotes to quote its special characters. As with\nthe other forms, this is all properly handled --- the shell knows just\nwhich characters need quoting inside double quotes, and which don\\'t.\nWord-splitting in double quotes\\\nWhere the substitutions are allowed, the (almost) invariable side effect\nof double quotes is that word-splitting is suppressed. You can see this\nusing `print -l\\', which prints one argument per line:\n  % array=(one two)\n  % print -l $(echo foo bar) $array\n  foo\n  bar\n  one\n  two\n  % print -l \"$(echo foo bar) $array\"\n  foo bar one two\nThe reason this is `almost\\' invariable is that parameter substitution\nallows you to specify that normal word-splitting will occur. There are\ntwo ways of doing this; both use the symbol `@\\'. You probably\nremember this from the parameter `$@\\' which has just that effect\nwhen it appears in double quotes: the arguments to the script or\nfunction are split into words like a normal array, except that empty\narguments are not removed. I covered this at some length in chapter\n3.\nThis is extended for other parameters in the following way:\n  % array=(one two three)\n  % print -l \"${array[@]}\"\n  one\n  two\n  three\nand more generally for all forms of substitution using another flag,\n(@):\n  % print -l \"${(@)array}\"\n  one\n  two\n  three\nDigression on subscripts\\\nThe version with flags is perhaps less clear than the other, but it can\nappear in lots of different places. For example, here is how you pick a\nslice of an array in zsh:\n  % print -l ${array[2,-1]}\n  two\n  three\nwhere negative numbers count from the end of the array. The numbers in\nsquare brackets are referred to as subscripts. This can get the (@)\ntreatment, too:\n  % print -l \"${(@)array[2,-1]}\"\n  two\n  three\nAlthough it\\'s probably not obvious, you can use the other notation in\nthis case:\n  % print -l \"${array[@][2,-1]}\"\n  two\n  three\nThe shell will actually handle arbitrary numbers of subscripts in\nparameter substitutions, not just one; each applies to the result of the\nprevious one:\n  % print -l \"${array[@][2,-1][1]}\"\n  two\nWhat you have to watch out for is that that last subscript selected a\nsingle word. You can continue to apply subscripts, but they will apply\nonly on the characters in that word, not on array elements:\n  % print -l \"${array[@][2,1][1][2,-1]}\"\n  wo\nWe\\'ve now strayed severely off topic: the subscripts will of course\nwork quite independently from whether the word is being split or appears\nin double quotes. Despite the joining of words that occurs in double\nquotes, subscripts of arrays still select array elements. This is a\nconsequence of the order in which the rules of parameter expansion\napply. There is a long, involved section on this in the zshexpn manual\nentry (look for the heading `Rules\\' there or in the `Parameter\nExpansion\\' node of the corresponding Info or HTML file).\nWord-splitting of quoted command substitutions\\\nZsh has the useful feature that you can force the shell to apply the\nrules of parameter expansion to the result of a command substitution. To\nsee where that might be useful, consider the case of the special\n`command substitution\\' (although it\\'s handled entirely in the shell,\nnot by running an external command) which puts the contents of a file on\nthe command line:\n  % args() { print $#; }    # report number of arguments\n  % cat file\n  Words on line one\n  Words on line two\n  % args $(The unquoted substitution split the file into individual words; the\nquoted substitution didn\\'t split it at all. These are the standard\nshell rules.\nIt\\'s very common, however, that you want one line per argument, not\nsplitting on spaces within the line. This is where parameter expansion\ncan come in. There is a flag (f) which says `split the result of the\nexpansion, one word per line\\'. Here\\'s how to use it in this case:\n  % args \"${(f)$(Where you would usually put the name of a parameter, you put the command\nsubstitution instead, and the shell operates on the result of that (note\nthat it does not treat the result as the name of a parameter, but as a\nvalue --- this is discussed in more detail below). The double quotes\nwere necessary because otherwise the file would already have been split\ninto individual words by the time the parameter substitution came to\nlook at the result. You can easily verify that the two arguments are the\nindividual lines of the file. I don\\'t remember what the `f\\' stands\nfor, but we were already using up flag codes quite fast when it came\nalong; Bart Schaefer believes it stands for `fold\\', which might at\nleast help you remember it.\n[]{#l117}\n5.1.5: Backquotes\nThe main thing to say about backquotes is that you should use the other\nform of command substitution instead. There are two good reasons.\nFirst, the other form can be nested:\n  % print $(print $(print a word))\n  a word\nObviously that\\'s a silly example, but the main point is that the only\ntime parentheses should occur unquoted in the shell is in pairs (the\npatterns in case statements are an exception, but pairs of parentheses\naround patterns are valid, too, and I have used that form in this\nguide). Thus you can be confident that any piece of well-formatted shell\ncode can appear inside the command substitution.\nThis is clearly not true with `...` , even though the basic effect\nis the same. Any unquoted `  which happens to appear in a chunk of\ncode within the backquotes will be treated as the end of the quotes.\nThe second reason, which is closely related, is that it can be quite\ndifficult to decide how many levels of quotes are required inside a\nbackquoted expression. Consider:\n  % print \"`echo \\\"hello\\\"`\"\n  hello\n  % print \"$(echo \\\"hello\\\")\"\n  \"hello\"\nIt\\'s hard to explain quite what the difference here is without waving\nmy hands, which prevents me from typing, but the essential point is\nreally the same one about nesting: you can\\'t do it with backquotes,\nbecause the start and end symbols are the same, but you can do it with\nparentheses. So in the second case there is no doubt that the embedded\ncommand line, `echo \\\"hello\\\"\\', is to be treated exactly as if that\nhad appeared outside the command substitution; whereas in the first\nplace, the quotes within quotes had to be, um, quoted.\nAs a consequence, in\n  % print \"$(echo \"hello\")\"\n  hello\nyou need to be careful: at first glance, the pairs of double quotes\nsurround `$(echo\\' and `)\\', but they don\\'t, they are nested by\nvirtue of the substitution. You see the same thing with parameter\nsubstitution:\n  % unset foo\n  % print \"${foo:-\"a string\"}\"\n  a string\nA third, less good, reason for using the form with parentheses is that\nyour more sophisticated friends will laugh at you otherwise. Peer\npressure is so important in this complex world.\nThat\\'s all I have to say about command substitution, since I already\nsaid a lot about it when I discussed the basic syntax in chapter\n3.\n[]{#l118}\n5.2: Modifiers and what they modify\nModifiers were introduced in chapter 2 when I\ntalked about `bang history\\', since that\\'s where they came from. In\nzsh, however, they can be used in a couple of other places. They have\nthe same form in each case: a colon, followed by a letter which is the\ncode for what the modifier does, possibly (in the case of substitutions)\nfollowed by some other string. So, to jog your memory, unless you have\nNO_BANG_HIST set:\n  % print ~/file\n  /home/pws/file\n  % print !-1:t\n  file\nwhere `:t\\' takes the tail (non-directory part) of the filename.\nThe second use is in parameters. This follows on very naturally. Note\nthat neither this nor any of the later uses of modifiers rely on the\nNO_BANG_HIST option; that\\'s purely for history.\n  % param=~/file\n  % print ${param:t}\n  file\nNormally you can miss out the braces in the parameter substitution, but\nI tend to use them with modifiers for the sake of clarity. The fact that\nthe same parts of the shell are used for modifiers wherever they come\nfrom has certain consequences:\n  % print foo\n  foo\n  % ^foo^bar\n  bar\n  % param='this sentence contains a foo.'\n  % print ${param:&}\n  this sentence contains a bar.\nThe ampersand repeats the last substitution, which is the same for\nparameter modifiers as for history modifiers. I find parameter modifiers\neven more useful than history ones; extracting the head or tail of a\npath is a very common operation on parameters.\nModifiers are also smart enough to handle arrays in a useful fashion.\nNote this is not true of sets of arguments in history expansions;\n`:t\\' will only extract one tail in that case, which may not be quite\nwhat you\\'re expecting:\n  % print a sentence with a /real/live/bogus/path in it.\n  % print !!:t\n  path in it.\nHowever, arrays are handled the way you might hope:\n  % array=(~/.zshenv ~/.zshrc ~/.zlogout)\n  % print ${array:t}\n  .zshenv .zshrc .zlogout\nThe same logic is applied with substitutions. This means that the first\nmatch in every element of the array is replaced:\n  % array=('a bar of chocolate' 'a bar of barflies' \n  array> 'a barrier of barns')\n  % print ${array:s/bar/car/}\n  a car of chocolate a car of barflies a carrier of barns\nunless, of course, you do a global replacement:\n  % print ${array:gs/bar/car/}\n  a car of chocolate a car of carflies a carrier of carns\nNote, however, that parameter substitution has its own much more\npowerful equivalent, which does pattern matching, partial replacement of\nmodified parts of the original string, and so on. We\\'ll come to this\nall in good time.\nThe final use of modifiers is in filename generation, i.e. globbing.\nSince this usually works by having special characters on the command\nline, and modifiers just consist of ordinary characters, the syntax is a\nlittle different:\n  % print *.c\n  parser.c lexer.c input.c output.c\n  % print *.c(:r)\n  parser lexer input output\nso you need parentheses around them. This is a special case of `glob\nqualifiers\\' which you\\'ll meet below; you can mix them, but the\nmodifiers must appear at the end. For example,\n  % print -l ~/stuff/*\n  /home/pws/stuff/onefile.c\n  /home/pws/stuff/twofile.c\n  /home/pws/stuff/subdir\n  % print ~/stuff/*(.:r:t)\n  onefile twofile\nThe globbing qualifier `.\\' specifies that files must be regular,\ni.e. not directories nor some form of special file. The `:r\\' removes\nthe suffix from the result, and the `:t\\' takes away the directory\npart. Consequently, filename modifiers will be turned off if you set the\noption NO_BARE_GLOB_QUAL.\nTwo final points to note about modifiers with filenames. First, it is\nthe only form of globbing where the result is no longer a filename; it\nis always performed right at the end, after all normal filename\ngeneration. Presumably, in the examples above, the word which was\ninserted into the command line doesn\\'t actually correspond to a real\nfile any more.\nSecond, although it does work if the word on the command line isn\\'t a\npattern but an ordinary word with a modifier tacked on, it doesn\\'t\nwork if that pattern, before modification, doesn\\'t correspond to a real\nfile. So `foo.c(:r)\\' will only strip off the suffix if foo.c is\nthere in the current directory. This is perfectly logical given that the\nattempt to match a file kicks the globbing system, including modifiers,\ninto action. If this is a problem for you, there are ways round; for\nexample, insert the right value by hand in a simple case like this, or\nmore realistically store the value in a parameter and apply the modifier\nto that.\n[]{#l119}\n5.3: Process Substitution\nI don\\'t have much new to say on process substitution, but I do have an\nexample of where I find it useful. If you use the pager `less\\' you may\nknow it has the facility to preprocess the files you look at, for\nexample uncompressing files temporarily via the environment variable\n$LESSOPEN (and maybe $LESSCLOSE). Zsh can very easily and, to my\nthoroughly unbiased way of looking, more conveniently do the same thing.\nHere\\'s a subset of my zsh function front-end to less --- or indeed\nany pager, which is given here by the standard environment variable\n$PAGER with the default less. You can hard-wire any file-displaying\ncommand at that point if you prefer.\n  integer i=1\n  local args arg\n  args=($*)\n\n  for arg in $*; do\n    case $arg in\n      (*.bz2) args[$i]=\"=(bunzip2 -c ${(q)arg})\"\n              ;;\n      # this assumes your zcat is the one installed with gzip:\n      (*.(gz|Z)) args[$i]=\"=(zcat ${(q)arg})\"\n                 ;;\n      (*) args=${(q)arg}\n          ;;\n    esac\n    (( i++ ))\n  done\n\n  eval command ${PAGER:-less} $args\nThe main pieces of interest is how elements of the array $args were\nreplaced. The reason each argument was given an extra layer of quotes\nvia (q) is the eval at the end; $args is turned into an array of\nliteral characters first, which hence need quoting to protect special\ncharacters. Without that, filenames with spaces or asterisks or whatever\nwouldn\\'t be shown properly.\nThe reason the eval is there is so that the process substitutions are\nevaluated on the command line when the pager is run, and not before.\nThey are assigned back to elements of $args in quotes, so don\\'t get\nevaluated at that point. The effect will be to turn:\n  less file.gz file.txt\ninto\n  less =(zcat file.gz) file.txt\nThe `command\\' at the end of the function is there just in case the\nfunction has the same name as the pager (i.e. `less\\' in this example);\nit forces the external command to be called rather than the function.\nThe process substitution is ideal in this context; it provides less\nwith the name of a file to which the decompressed contents of file.gz\nhave been sent, and it deletes the file after the command exits.\nFurthermore, the substitution happens in such a way that you can still\nspecify multiple files on the command line as you usually can with less.\nThe only problem is that the filename that appears in the `less\\'\nprompt is meaningless.\nIn case you haven\\'t come across it, bzip2 is a programme very similar\nto gzip, and it is used almost identically, but it provides better\ncompression.\nThere\\'s an infelicity in output process substitutions, just as there is\nwith multios.\n  echo hello > >(sed s/hello/goodbye)\nThe shell spawns the sed process to handle the output from the command\nline --- and then forgets about it. It does not wait for it (at least,\nnot until after it exits, when it will use the wait system call to\ntidy up). So it is dangerous to rely on the result of the process being\navailable in the next command. If you try it interactively, in fact, you\nmay well find that the next prompt is printed before the output from\nsed shows up on the terminal. This can probably be considered a bug,\nbut it is quite difficult to fix.\n[]{#l120}\n5.4: Parameter substitution\nYou can probably see from the above that parameter substitutions are at\nthe heart of much of the power available to transform zsh command lines.\nWhat\\'s more, we haven\\'t covered even a significant fraction of what\\'s\non offer.\n[]{#l121}\n5.4.1: Using arrays\nThe array syntax in zsh is quite powerful (surprised?); just don\\'t\nexpect it to be as efficient as, say, perl. Like other features of zsh,\nit exists to make users\\' lives easier, not to make your computer run\nblindingly fast.\nI\\'ve covered, somewhat sporadically, how to set arrays, and how to\nextract bits of them --- the following illustrates this:\n  % array=(one two three four)\n  % print ${array}\n  one two three four\n  % print ${array[3]}\n  three\n  % print ${array[2,-1]}\n  two three four\nRemember you need `typeset\\' or equivalent if you want the array to\nbe local to a function. The neat way is `typeset -a\\', which creates\nan empty array, but as long as you assign to the array before trying to\nuse it any old typeset will do.\nYou can use the array index and array slice notations for assigning to\narrays, in other words on the left-hand side of an `=\\':\n  % array=(what kind of fool am i)\n  % array[2]=species\n  % print $array\n  what species of fool am i\n  % array[2]=(a piece)\n  % print $array\n  what a piece of fool am i\n  % array[-3,-1]=(work is a man)\n  % print $array\n  what a piece of work is a man\nSo you can replace a single element of an array by a single element, or\nby an array slice; likewise you can replace a slice in one go by a slice\nof a different length --- only the bits you explicitly tell it to\nreplace are changed, the rest is left intact and maybe shifted along to\nmake way. This is similar to perl\\'s `splice\\' command, only for once\nmaybe a bit more memorable. Note that you shouldn\\'t supply any braces\non the left hand side. The appearance of the expression in an assignment\nis enough to trigger the special behaviour of subscripts, even if\nKSH_ARRAYS is in effect --- though you need to subtract one from\nyour subscripts in that case.\nYou can remove bits in the middle, too, but note you should use an empty\narray:\n  % array=(one two three four)\n  % print $#array\n  4\n  % array[2]=\n  % print $#array\n  4\n  % array[2]=()\n  % print $#array\n  3\nThe first assignment set element 2 to the empty string, it didn\\'t\nremove it. The second replaced the array element with an array of length\nzero, which did remove it.\nJust as parameter substitutions have flags for special purposes, so do\nsubscripts. You can force them to search through arrays, matching on the\nvalues. You can return the value matched ((r)everse subscripting):\n  % array=(se vuol ballare signor contino)\n  % print ${array[(r)s*]}\n  se\n  % print ${array[(R)s*]}\n  signor\nThe (r) flag takes a pattern and substitutes the first element of the\narray matched, while the (R) flag does the same but starting from the\nend of the array. If nothing matched, you get the empty string; as usual\nwith parameters, this will be omitted if it\\'s the only thing in an\nunquoted argument. Using our args function to count the arguments\npassed to a command again:\n  % array=(some words)\n  % args() { print $#; }\n  % args ${array[(r)s*]}\n  1\n  % args ${array[(r)X*]}\n  0\n  % args \"${array[(r)X*]}\"\n  1\nwhere in the last case the empty string was quoted, and passed down as a\nsingle, empty argument.\nYou can also return the index matched; (i) to start matching from the\nbeginning, and (I) to start from the end.\n  % array=(se vuol venire nella mia scuola)\n  % print ${array[(i)v*]}\n  2\n  % print ${array[(I)v*]}\n  3  \nmatching `vuol\\' the first time and `venire\\' the second. What happens\nif they don\\'t match may be a little unexpected, but is reasonably\nlogical: you get the next index along. In other words, failing to match\nat the end gives you the length of the array plus one, and failing to\nmatch at the beginning gives you zero, so:\n  array=(three egregious words)\n  for pat in '*e*e*' '*a*a*'; do\n    if [[ ${array[(i)$pat]} -le ${#array} ]]; then\n      print \"Pattern $pat matched in array: ${array[(r)$pat]}.\"\n    else\n      print \"Pattern $pat failed to match in array\"\n    fi\n  done\nprints:\n  Pattern *e*e* matched in array: three.\n  Pattern *a*a* failed to match in array\nIf you adapt that chunk of code, you\\'ll see you get the indices 1 and 4\nreturned. Note that the characters in $pat were treated as a pattern\neven though putting $pat on the command line would normally just\nproduce the characters themselves. Subscripts are special in that way;\ntrying to keep the syntax under control at this point is a little hairy.\nThere is a more detailed description of this in the manual in the\nsection `Subscript Parsing\\' of the zshparam manual page or the\n`Array Parameters\\' info node; to quote the characters in pat, you\nwould actually have to supply the command line strings '\\*e\\*e\\*' and\n'\\*a\\*a\\*'. Just go round mumbling `extra layer of pattern\nexpansion\\' and everyone will think you know what you\\'re talking about\n(it works for me, fitfully).\nThere is currently no way of extracting a complete set of matches from\nan ordinary array with subscript flags. We\\'ll see other ways of doing\nthat below, however.\n[]{#l122}\n5.4.2: Using associative arrays\nLook back at chapter 3 if you\\'ve forgotten\nabout associative arrays. These take subscripts, like ordinary arrays\ndo, but here the subscripts are arbitrary strings (or keys) associated\nwith the value stored in the element of the array. Remember, you need to\nuse `typeset -A\\' to create one, or one of typeset\\'s relatives\nwith the same option. This means that if you created it inside a\nfunction it will be limited to the local scope, so if you want to create\na global associative array you will need to give the -g flag as well.\nThis is particularly common with associative arrays, which are often\nused to store global information such as configuration details.\nRetrieving information from associative arrays can get you into some of\nthe problems already hinted at in the use of subscript flags with\narrays. However, since normal subscripting doesn\\'t make patterns\nactive, there is a way round here: make the subscript into another\nparameter:\n  % typeset -A assoc\n  % assoc=(key value Shlüssel Wert clavis valor)\n  % subscript='key'\n  % print ${assoc[$subscript]}\n  value  \nI used fairly boring keys here, but they can be any string of\ncharacters:\n  % assoc=(']' right\\ square\\ bracket '*' asterisk '@' at\\ sign)\n  % subscript=']'\n  % print ${assoc[$subscript]}\n  right square bracket\nand that is harder to get the other way. Nonetheless, if you define\nyour own keys you will often use simple words, and in that case they can\nhappily appear directly in the square brackets.\nI introduced two parameter flags, (k) and (v) in chapter\n3:\n  % print ${(k)assoc}\n  * ] @\nprints out keys, while\n  % print ${(kv)assoc}\n  * asterisk ] right square bracket @ at sign\nand the remaining two possibilities do the same thing:\n  % print ${(v)assoc}\n  asterisk right square bracket at sign\n  % print ${assoc}\n  asterisk right square bracket at sign\nYou now know these are part of a much larger family of tricks to apply\nto substitutions. There\\'s nothing to stop you combining flags:\n  % print -r ${(qkv)assoc}\n  \\* asterisk \\] right\\ square\\ bracket @ at\\ sign\nwhich helps see the wordbreaks. Don\\'t forget the `print -l\\' trick\nfor separating out different words, and hence elements of arrays and\nassociative arrays:\n  % print -l ${(kv)assoc}\n  *\n  asterisk\n  ]\n  right square bracket\n  @\n  at sign\nwhich is quite a lot clearer. As always, this will fail if you engage in\nun-zsh activities with SH_WORD_SPLIT, but judicious use of @,\nwhether as a flag or a subscript, and double quotes, will always work:\n  % print -l \"${(@kv)assoc}\"\n  *\n  asterisk\n  ]\n  right square bracket\n  @\n  at sign\nregardless of the option setting.\nApart from the subscripts, the second major difference between\nassociative and ordinary arrays is that the former don\\'t have any order\ndefined. This will be entirely familiar if you have used Perl; the\nprinciple here is identical. However, zsh has no notion at all, even as\na convenience, of slices of associative arrays. You can assign\nindividual elements or whole associative arrays --- remembering that\nin the second case the right hand side must consist of key/value pairs\n--- but you can\\'t assign subgroups. Any attempt to use the slice\nnotation with commas will be met by a stern error message.\nWhat zsh does have, however, is extra subscript flags for you to match\nand retrieve one or more elements. If instead of an ordinary subscript\nyou use a subscript preceded by the flag (i), the shell will search\nfor a matching key (not value) with the pattern given and return that.\nThis is deliberately the same as searching an ordinary array to get its\nkey (which in that case is just a number, the index), but note this time\nit doesn\\'t match on the value, it really does match, as well as return,\nthe key:\n  % typeset -A assoc\n  % assoc=(fred third\\ man finnbar slip roger gully trevor long\\ off)\n  % print ${assoc[(i)f*]}\n  fred\nYou can still use the parameter flags (k) and (v) to tell the shell\nwhich part of the key and/or value to return:\n  % print ${(kv)assoc[(i)f*]}\n  fred third man\nNote the division of labour. The subscript flag tells the shell what to\nmatch against, while the parameter flags tell it which bit of the\nmatched element(s) you actually want to see.\nBecause of the essentially random ordering of associative arrays, you\ncouldn\\'t tell here whether fred or finnbar would be chosen. However,\nyou can use the capital form (I) to tell the shell to retrieve all\nmatches. This time, let\\'s see the values of the elements for which the\nkeys were matched:\n  % print -l ${(v)assoc[(I)f*]}\n  third man\n  slip\nand here we also got the position occupied by finnbar. The same rules\nabout patterns apply as with (r) in ordinary arrays --- a subscript\nis treated as a pattern even if it came from a parameter substitution\nitself.\nYou probably aren\\'t surprised to hear that the subscript flags (r)\nand (R) try to match the values of the associative array rather than\nits keys. These, too, print out the actual part matched, here the value,\nunless you use the parameter flags.\n  % print ${assoc[(r)*i*]}\n  third man\n  % print ${(k)assoc[(R)*i*]}\n  fred finnbar\nThere\\'s one more pair of subscript flags of particular relevance to\nassociative arrays, (k) and (K). These work a bit like a case\nstatement: the subscripts are treated as strings, and the keys of the\nassociative arrays as patterns, instead of the other way around. With\n(k), the value of the first key which matches the subscript is\nsubstituted; with (K), the values of all matching keys are substituted\n  % typeset -A assoc\n  % assoc=('[0-9]' digit '[a-zA-Z]' letter '[^0-9a-zA-Z]' neither)\n  % print ${assoc[(k)0]}\n  digit\n  % print ${assoc[(k)_]}\n  neither\nIn case you\\'re still confused, the `0\\' in the first subscript was\ntaken as a string and all the keys in $assoc were treated as patterns\nin turn, a little like\n  case 0 in\n    ([0-9]) print digit\n            ;;\n    ([a-zA-Z]) print letter\n               ;;\n    ([^0-9a-zA-Z]) print neither\n                   ;;\n  esac\nOne important way in which this is not like the selection in a case\nstatement is that you can\\'t rely on the order of the comparison, so you\ncan\\'t rely on more general patterns being matched after more specific\nones. You just have to use keys which are sufficiently explicit to match\njust the strings you want to match and no others. That\\'s why we picked\nthe pattern `[^0-9a-zA-Z]\\' instead of just `*\\' as we would\nprobably have used in the case statement.\nI said storing information about configuration was a common use of\nassociative arrays, but the shell has a more powerful way of doing that:\nstyles, which will figure prominently in the discussion of programmable\ncompletion in the next chapter. The major advantage of styles over\nassociative arrays is that they can be made context-sensitive; you can\neasily make the same style return the same value globally, or make it\nhave a default but with a different value in one particular context, or\ngive it a whole load of different values in different places. Each shell\napplication can decide what is meant by a `context\\'; you are not tied\nto the same scheme as the completion system uses, or anything like it.\nUse of hierarchical contexts in the manner of the completion system does\nmean that it is easy to create sets of styles for different modules\nwhich don\\'t clash.\nHere, finally, is a comparison of some of the uses of associative arrays\nin perl and zsh.\n      perl                          zsh\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n  %hash = qw(key value);         typeset -A hash; hash=(key value)\n  $hash{key}                     ${hash[key]}\n  keys %hash                     ${(k)hash}\n  values %hash                   ${(v)hash}\n  %hash2 = %hash;                typeset -A hash2; hash2=(\"${(@kv)hash}\")\n  unset %hash;                   unset hash\n  if (exists $hash{key}) {       if (( ${+hash[key]} )); then\n    ...                            ...\n  }                              fi\nOne final reminder: if you are creating associative arrays inside a\nfunction which need to last beyond the end of the function, you should\ncreate them with `typeset -gA\\' which puts them into the surrounding\nscope. The `-g\\' flag is of course useful with all types of\nparameter, but the associative array is the only type that doesn\\'t\nautomatically spring into existence when you assign to it in the right\ncontext; hence the flag is particularly worthy of note here.\n[]{#l123}\n5.4.3: Substituted substitutions, top- and tailing, etc.\nThere are many transformations which you can do on the result of a\nparameter substitution. The most powerful involve the use of patterns.\nFor this, the more you know about patterns, the better, so I will\nreserve explanation of some of the whackiest until after I have gone\ninto more detail on patterns. In particular, it\\'s useful if you know\nhow to tell the shell to mark subexpressions which it has matched for\nfuture extraction. However, you can do some very useful things with just\nthe basic patterns common to all shells.\nStandard forms: lengths\\\nI\\'ll separate out zsh-specific forms, and start off with some which\nappear in all shells derived from the Bourne shell. A more compact\n(read: terse) list is given in the manual, as always.\nA few simple forms don\\'t use patterns. First, the substitution\n${#param} outputs the length of $param. In zsh, you don\\'t\nneed the braces here, though in most other shells with this feature you\ndo. Note that ${#} on its own is the number of parameters in the\ncommand line argument array, which is why explicit use of braces is\nclearer.\n$# works differently on scalar values and array values; in the former\ncase, it gives the length in characters, and in the latter case the\nlength in elements. Note that I said `values\\', not `parameters\\'\n--- you have to work out whether the substitution is giving you a\nscalar or an array:\n  % print ${#path}\n  8\n  % print ${#path[1]}\n  13\nThe first result shows I have 8 directories in my path, the latter that\nthe first directory (actually `/home/pws/bin\\') has 13 characters.\nYou should bear this in mind with nested substitutions, as discussed\nbelow, which can also return either an array or a scalar.\nEarlier versions of zsh always returned a character count if the\nexpression was in double quotes, or anywhere the shell evalauted the\nexpression as a single word, but that doesn\\'t happen any more; it\ndepends only on the type of the value. However, you can force the shell\nto count characters by using the (c) flag, and to count words (even in\nscalars, which it will split if necessary) by using (w):\n  % print ${#PATH}\n  84\n  % print ${(c)#path}\n  84\n  % foo=\"three scalar words\"\n  % print ${(w)#foo}\n  3\nComparing the first two, you will see that character count with arrays\nincludes the space used for separating (equal to the number of colons\nseparating the elements in $PATH). There\\'s a relative of (w) called\n(W), which treats multiple word separators as having zero-length words\nin between:\n  % foo=\"three  well-spaced  word\"\n  % print ${(w)#foo}\n  3\n  % print ${(W)#foo}\n  5\ngiving two extra words over (w), which treats the groups of spaces in\nthe same way as one. Being parameter flags, these modifications of the\nsyntax are specific to zsh.\nNote that if you use lengths in an arithmetic context (inside ((...))\nor $((...))), you must include the leading `$\\', which you don\\'t\nneed for substituting the parameters themselves. That\\'s because\n`#foo\\' means something different here --- the number in the ASCII\ncharacter set (or whatever extension of it you are using if it is an\nextended character set) of the first character in $foo.\nStandard forms: conditional substitutions\\\nThe next group of substitutions is a whole series where the parameter is\nfollowed by an option colon and then `-\\', `=\\', `+\\' or\n`?\\'. The colon has the same effect in each case: without a colon,\nthe shell tests whether the parameter is set before performing the\noperation, while with the colon it tests whether the parameter has\nnon-zero length.\nThe simplest is `${param:-value}\\'. If $param has non-zero\nlength (without the colon, if it is set at all), use its value, else use\nthe value supplied. Suppose $foo wasn\\'t set at the start of the\nfollowing (however unlikely that may seem):\n  % print ${foo-bar}\n  bar\n  % foo=''\n  % print ${foo-bar}\n\n  % print ${foo:-bar}\n  bar\n  % foo='please no anything but bar'\n  % print ${foo:-bar}\n  please no anything but bar\nIt\\'s more usual to use the form with the colon. One reason for that is\nthat in functions you will often create the parameter with a typeset\nbefore using it, in which case it always exists, initially with zero\nlength, so that the other form would never use the default value. I\\'ll\nuse the colon for describing the other three types.\n`${param:=value}\\' is similar to the previous type. but in\nthis case the shell will not only substitute value into the line, it\nwill assign it to param if (and only if) it does so. This leads to the\nfollowing common idiom in scripts and functions:\n  : ${MYPARAM:=default}  ${OTHERPARAM:=otherdefault}\nIf the user has already set $MYPARAM, nothing happens, otherwise it\nwill be set to `default\\', and similarly for ${OTHERPARAM}. The\n`:\\' command does nothing but return true after the command line has\nbeen processed.\n`${param:+value}\\' is the opposite of `:-\\', logically\nenough: the value is substituted if the parameter doesn\\'t have zero\nlength. In this case, value will often be another parameter\nsubstitution:\n  print ${value:+\"the value of value is $value\"}\nprints the string only if $#value is greater than zero. Note that what\ncan appear after the `+\\' is pretty much any single word the shell\ncan parse; all the usual single-word substitutions (so globbing is\nexcluded) will be applied to it, and quotes will work just the same as\nusual. This applies to the values after `:-\\' and `:=\\', too. One\nother commonly seen trick might be worth mentioning:\n  print ${1+\"$@\"}\nsubstitutes all the positional parameters as they were passed if the\nfirst one was set (here you don\\'t want the colon). This was necessary\nin some old shells because \"$@\" on its own gave you a single empty\nargument instead of no arguments when no arguments were passed. This\nworkaround isn\\'t necessary in zsh, nor in most modern Bourne-derived\nshells. There\\'s a bug in zsh\\'s handling, however; see the section on\nfunction parameters in chapter 3.\nThe final type isn\\'t that often used (meaning I never have):\n${param?message} tests if param is set (no colon), and if it\nisn\\'t, prints the message and exits the shell. An interactive shell\nwon\\'t exit, but it will return you immediately to the prompt, skipping\nanything else stored up for execution. It\\'s a rudimentary safety\nfeature, a little bit like `assert\\' in C programmes; most shell\nprogrammers seem to cover the case of missing parameter settings by more\nverbose tests. It\\'s quite neat in short shell functions for interactive\nuse:\n  mless() { mtype ${@:?missing filename} | $PAGER }\nStandard forms: pattern removal\\\nMost of the more sophisticated Bourne-like shells define two pairs of\npattern operators, which I shall call `top and tail\\' operators. One\npair (using `#\\' and `##\\') removes a given pattern from the head\nof the string, returning the rest, while the other pair (using `%\\'\nand `%%\\') removes a pattern from the tail of the string. In each\ncase, the form with one symbol removes the shortest matching pattern,\nwhile the one with two symbols removes the longest matching pattern. Two\ntypical uses are:\n  % print $HOME\n  /home/pws\n  % print ${HOME##*/}\n  pws\n  % print ${HOME%/*}\n  /home\nwhich here have the same effect of ${HOME:t} and and ${HOME:h}, and\nin zsh you would be more likely to use the latter. However, as you can\nsee the pattern forms are much more general. Note the difference from:\n  % print ${HOME#*/}\n  home/pws\n  % print ${HOME%%/*}\nwhere the shortest match of `*/\\' at the head was just the first\nslash, since `*\\' can match an empty string, while the longest match\nof `/*\\' at the tail was the entire string, right back to the first\nslash. Although these are standard forms, remember that the full power\nof zsh patterns is available.\nHow do you remember which operator does what? The fact that the longer\nform does the longer match is probably easy. Remembering that `#\\'\nremoves at the head and `%\\' at the tail is harder. Try to think of\n`hash\\' and `head\\' (if you call it a `pound sign\\', when it\\'s\nnothing of the sort since a pound since looks like `£\\', you will get\nno sympathy from me), and `percent\\' and `posterior\\'. It never worked\nfor me, but maybe I just don\\'t have the mental discipline. Oliver\nKiddle points out that `#\\' is further to the left (head) on a\nstandard US keyboard. On my UK keyboard, `#\\' is right next to the\nreturn key, unfortunately, although here the confusion with `pound\nsign\\' will jog your memory.\nThe most important thing to remember is: this notation is not our fault.\nSorry, anyway. By the way, notice there\\'s no funny business with colons\nin the case of the pattern operators. (Well --- except for the zsh\nvariant noted below.)\nZsh-specific parameter substitutions\\\nNow for some enhancements that zsh has for using the forms of parameter\nsubstitution I\\'ve just given as well as some similar but different\nones.\nOne simple enhancement is that in addition to\n`${param=value}\\' and `${param:=value}\\', zsh has\n`${param::=value}\\' which performs an unconditional\nassignment as well as sticking the value on the command line. It\\'s not\nreally any different from using a normal assignment, then a normal\nparameter substitution, except that zsh users like densely packed code.\nAll the assignment types are affected by the parameter flags `A\\' and\n`AA\\' which tell the shell to perform array and associative array\nassignment (in the second case, you need pairs of key/value elements as\nusual). You need to be a little bit careful with array elements and word\nsplitting, however:\n  % print -l ${(A)foo::=one two three four}\n  one two three four\n  % print ${#foo}\n  1\nThat made $foo an array all right, but treated the argument as a\nscalar value and assigned it to the first element. There\\'s a way round\nthis:\n  % print -l ${(A)=foo::=one two three four}\n  one\n  two\n  three\n  four\n  % print ${#foo}\n  4\nHere, the `=\\' before the parameter name has a completely different\neffect from the others: it turns on word-splitting, just as if the\noption SH_WORD_SPLIT is in effect. You may remember I went into this\nin appalling detail in the section `Function parameters\\' in chapter\n3.\nYou should be careful, however, as more sophisticated attempts at\nputting arrays inside parameter values can easily lead you astray. It\\'s\nusually much easier to use the `array=(...)\\' or `set -A\n...\\' notations.\nOne extremely useful zsh enhancement is the notation `${+foo}\\' which\nreturns 1 if $foo is set and 0 if it isn\\'t. You can use this in\narithmetic expressions. This is a much more flexible way of dealing with\npossibly unset parameters than the more standard `${foo?goodbye}\\'\nnotation, and consequently is better used by zsh programmers. The\nnotation `plus foo\\' for `foo is set\\' should be fairly memorable,\ntoo. A more standard way of doing this (noted by David Korn) is\n`0${foo+1}\\', giving 0 if $foo is not set and 01 if it is.\nParameter flags and pattern substitutions\\\nZsh increases the usefulness of the `top and tail\\' operators with some\nof its parameter flags. Usually these show you what\\'s left after the\nremoval of some matched portion. However, with the flag (M) the shell\nwill instead show you the matched portion itself. The flag (R) is the\nopposite and shows the rest: that\\'s not all that useful in the normal\ncase, since you get that by default. It only starts being useful when\nyou combine it with other flags.\nNext, zsh allows you to match on substrings, not just on the head or\ntail. You can do this by giving the flag (S) with either of the\n`#\\' or `%\\' pattern-matching forms. The difference here is\nwhether the shell starts searching for a matching substring at the start\nor end of the full string. Let\\'s take\n  foo='where I was huge lizards walked here and there'\nand see what we get matching on `h*e\\':\n  % print -l ${(S)foo#h*e} ${(S)foo##h*e} ${(S)foo%h*e} ${(S)foo%%h*e}\n  wre I was huge lizards walked here and there\n  w\n  where I was huge lizards walked here and tre\n  where I was huge lizards walked here and t\nThere are some odd discrepancies at first sight, but here\\'s what\nhappens. In the first case, `#\\' the shell looks forward until it\nfinds a match for `h*e\\', and takes the shortest, which is the\n`he\\' in the first word. With `##\\', the match succeeds at the\nsame point, but the longest match extends to the `e\\' right at the\nend of the string. With the other two forms, the shell starts scanning\nbackwards from the end, and stops as soon as it reaches a starting point\nwhich has a match. For both `%\\' and `%%\\' this is the last\n`h\\', but the former matches `he\\' and the latter matches\n`here\\'.\nYou can extend this by using the (I) flag to specify a numeric index.\nThe index needs to be delimited, conventionally, although not\nnecessarily, by colons. The shell will then scan forward or backward,\ndepending on the form used, until it has found the (I)\\'th match. Note\nthat it only ever counts a single match from each position, either the\nlongest or the shortest, so the (I)\\'th match starts from the\n(I)\\'th position which has any match. Here\\'s what happens when we\nremove all the matches for `#\\' using the example above.\n  % for (( i = 1; i  print ${(SI:$i:)foo#h*e}\n  for> done\n  wre I was huge lizards walked here and there\n  where I was  lizards walked here and there\n  where I was huge lizards walked re and there\n  where I was huge lizards walked here and tre\n  where I was huge lizards walked here and there\nEach time we match and remove one of the possible `h*e\\' sets where\nthere is no `e\\' in the middle, moving from left to right. The last\ntime there was nothing left to match and the complete string was\nreturned. Note that the index we used was itself a parameter.\nIt\\'s obvious what happens with `##\\': it will find matches at all\nthe same points, but they will all extend to the `e\\' at the end of\nthe string. It\\'s probably less obvious what happens with `%%\\' and\n`%\\', but if you try it you will find they produce just the same set\nof matches as `##\\' and `#\\', respectively, but with the indices\nin the reverse order (4 for 1, 3 for 2, etc.).\nYou can use the `M\\' flag to leave the matched portion rather than\nthe rest of the string, if you like. There are three other flags which\nlet you get the indices associated with the match instead of the string:\n(B) for the beginning, using the usual zsh convention where the first\ncharacter is 1, (E) for the character after the end, and (N) for\nthe length, simply B-E. You can even have more than one of these; the\nvalue substituted is a string with the given values with spaces between,\nalways in the order beginning, end, length.\nThere is a sort of opposite to the `(S)\\' flag, which instead of\nmatching substrings will only match the whole string; to do this, put a\ncolon before the `#\\'. Hence:\n  % print ${foo:#w*g}\n  where I was huge lizards walked here and there\n  % print ${foo:#w*e}\n\n  % \nThe first one didn\\'t match, because the `g\\' is not at the end; the\nsecond one did, because there is an `e\\' at the end.\nPattern replacement\\\nThe most powerful of the parameter pattern-matching forms has been\nborrowed from bash and ksh93; it doesn\\'t occur in traditional Bourne\nshells. Here, you use a pair of `/\\'s to indicate a pattern to be\nreplaced, and its replacement. Lets use the lizards again:\n  % print ${foo/h*e/urgh}\n  wurgh\nA bit incomprehensible: that\\'s because like most pattern matchers it\ntakes the longest match unless told otherwise. In this case the (S)\nflag has been pressed into service to mean not a substring (that\\'s\nautomatic) but the shortest match:\n  % print ${(S)foo/h*e/urgh}\n  wurghre I was huge lizards walked here and there\nThat only replace the first match. This is where `//\\' comes in; it\nreplaces every match:\n  % print ${(S)foo//h*e/urgh}\n  wurghre I was urgh lizards walked urghre and turghre\n(No doubt you\\'re starting to feel like a typical anachronistic\nHollywood cave-dweller already.) Note the syntax: it\\'s a little bit\nlike substitution in sed or perl, but there\\'s no slash at the end,\nand with `//\\' only the first slash is doubled. It\\'s a bit confusing\nthat with the other pattern expressions the single and double forms mean\nthe shortest and longest match, while here it\\'s the flag (S) that\nmakes the difference.\nThe index flag (I) is useful here, too. In the case of `/\\', it\ntells the shell which single match to substitute, and in the case of\n`//\\' it tells the shell at which match to start: all matches\nstarting from that are replaced.\nOverlapping matches are never replaced by `//\\'; once it has put the\nnew text in for a match, that section is not considered further and the\ntext just to its right is examined for matches. This is probably\nfamiliar from other substitution schemes.\nYou may well be thinking `wouldn\\'t it be good to be able to use the\nmatched text, or some part of it, in the replacment text?\\' This is what\nyou can do in sed with `\\1\\' or `\\&\\' and in perl with `$1\\'\nand `$&\\'. It turns out this is possible with zsh, due to part of\nthe more sophisticated pattern matching features. I\\'ll talk about this\nwhen we come on to patterns, since it\\'s not really part of parameter\nsubstitution, although it\\'s designed to work well with that.\n[]{#l124}\n5.4.4: Flags for options: splitting and joining\nThere are three types of flag that don\\'t look like flags, for\nhistorical reasons; you\\'ve already seen them in chapter\n3. The first is the one that turns on the\nSH_WORD_SPLIT option, ${=foo}. Note that you can mix this with flags\nthat do look like flags, in parentheses, in which case the `=\\'\nmust come after the closing parenthesis. You can force the option to be\nturned off for a single substitution by doubling the symbol:\n`${==foo}\\'. However, you wouldn\\'t do that unless the option was\nalready set, in which case you are probably trying to be compatible with\nsome other shell, and wouldn\\'t want to use that form.\nMore control over splitting and joining is possible with three of the\nmore standard type of flags, (s), (j) and (z). These do splitting\non a given string, joining with a given string, and splitting just the\nway the shell does it, respectively. In the first two cases, you need to\nspecify the string in the same way as you specified the index for the\n(I) flag. So, for example, here\\'s how to turn $PATH into an\nordinary array without using $path:\n  % print -l ${(s.:.)PATH}\n  /home/pws/bin\n  /usr/local/bin\n  /usr/sbin\n  /sbin\n  /bin\n  /usr/bin\n  /usr/X11R6/bin\n  /usr/games\nAny character can follow the (s) or (j); the string argument lasts\nuntil the matching character, here `.\\'. If the character is one of\nthe bracket-like characters including `\\', the `matching\\'\ncharacter is the corresponding right bracket, e.g. `${(s)PATH}\\'\nand `${(s(:))PATH}\\' are both valid. This applies to all flags that\nneed arguments, including (I).\nAlthough the split or join string isn\\'t a pattern, it doesn\\'t have to\nbe a single character:\n  % foo=(array of words)\n  % print ${(j.**.)foo}\n  array**of**words\nThe (z) flag doesn\\'t take an argument. As it handles splitting on the\nfull shell definition of a word, it goes naturally with quoted\nexpressions, and I discussed above its use with the (Q) flag for\nextracting words from a line with the quotes removed.\nIt\\'s possible for the same parameter expression to have both splitting\nand joining applied to it. This always occurs in the same order,\nregardless of how you specify the flags: joining first, then splitting.\nThis is described in the (rather hairy) complete set of rules in the\nmanual entry for parameter substitution. There are one or two occasions\nwhere this can be a bit surprising. One is when you have SH_WORD_SPLIT\nset and try to join a string:\n  % setopt shwordsplit    \n  % foo=('another array' of 'words with spaces')\n  % print -l ${(j.:.)foo}\n  another\n  array:of:words\n  with\n  spaces\nYou might not have noticed if you didn\\'t use the `-l option to\nprint, but the spaces still caused word-spliting even though you asked\nfor the array to be joined with colons. To avoid this, either don\\'t use\nSH_WORD_SPLIT (my personal preference), or use quotes:\n  % print -l \"${(j.:.)foo}\"\n  another array:of:words with spaces\nThe elements of an array would normally be joined by spaces in this\ncase, but the character specified by the (j) flag takes precedence. In\njust the same way, if SH_WORD_SPLIT is in effect, any splitting string\ngiven by (s) is used instead of the normal set of characters, which\nare any characters that occur in the string $IFS, by default space,\ntab, newline and NUL.\nSpecifying a split for a particular parameter substitution not only sets\nthe string to split on, but also ensures the split will take place even\nif the expression is quoted:\n  % array=('element one' 'element two' 'element three')\n  % print -l \"${=array}\"\n  element\n  one\n  element\n  two\n  element\n  three\nTo be clear about what\\'s happening here: the quotes force the elements\nto be joined with spaces, giving a single string, which is then split on\nthe original spaces as well as the one used to join the elements of the\narray.\nI will talk shortly about nested parameter substitution; you should also\nnote that splitting and joining will if necessary take place at all\nlevels of a nested substitution, not just the outermost one:\n  % foo=\"three blind words\"\n  % print ${#${(z)foo}}\n  3\nThis prints the length of the innermost expression; because of the\nzplit, that has produced a three-element array.\n[]{#l125}\n5.4.5: Flags for options: GLOB_SUBST and RC_EXPAND_PARAM\nThe other two flags that don\\'t use parentheses affect options for\nsingle substitutions, too. The second is the `~\\' flag that turns on\nGLOB_SUBST, making the result of a parameter substitution eligible for\npattern matching. As the notation is supposed to indicate, it also makes\nfilename expansion possible, so\n  % foo='~'\n  % print ${~foo}\n  /home/pws\nIt\\'s that first `~\\' which is giving the home directory; the one in\nthe parameter expansion simply allows that to happen. If you have\nGLOB_SUBST set, you can use `${~~foo}\\' to turn it off for one\nsubstitution.\nThere\\'s one other of these option flags: `^\\' forces on\nRC_EXPAND_PARAM for the current substitution, and `^^\\' forces it\noff. In chapter 3, I showed how parameters\nexpanded with this option on fitted in with brace expansions.\n[]{#l126}\n5.4.6: Yet more parameter flags\nHere are a few other parameter flags; I\\'m repeating some of these. A\nvery useful one is `t\\' to tell you the type of a parameter. This\ncame up in chapter 3 as well. It\\'s most\ncommon use is to test the basic type of the parameter before trying to\nuse it:\n  if [[ ${(t)myparam} != *assoc* ]]; then\n    # $myparam is not an associative array.  Do something about it.\n  fi\nAnother very useful type is for left or right padding of a string, to a\nspecified length, and optionally with a specified fill string to use\ninstead of space; you can even specify a one-off string to go right next\nto the string in question.\n  foo='abcdefghij'\n  for (( i = 1; i prints out the rather pretty:\n  XXXXXXXXYa aYXXXXXXXX\n  XXXXXXXYab abYXXXXXXX\n  XXXXXXYabc abcYXXXXXX\n  XXXXXYabcd abcdYXXXXX\n  XXXXYabcde abcdeYXXXX\n  XXXYabcdef abcdefYXXX\n  XXYabcdefg abcdefgYXX\n  XYabcdefgh abcdefghYX\n  Yabcdefghi abcdefghiY\n  abcdefghij abcdefghij\nNote that those colons (which can be other characters, as I explained\nfor the (s) and (j) flags) always occur in pairs before and after\nthe argument, so that with three arguments, the colons in between are\ndoubled. You can miss out the `:Y:\\' part and the `:X:\\' part and\nsee what happens. The fill strings don\\'t need to be single characters;\nif they don\\'t fit an exact number of times into the filler space, the\nlast repetition will be truncated on the end furthest from the parameter\nargument being inserted.\nTwo parameters tell the shell that you want something special done with\nthe value of the parameter substitution. The (P) flag forces the value\nto be treated as a parameter name, so that you get the effect of a\ndouble substitution:\n  % final=string\n  % intermediate=final\n  % print ${(P)intermediate}\n  string\nThis is a bit as if $intermediate were what in ksh is called a\n`nameref\\', a parameter that is marked as a reference to another\nparameter. Zsh may eventually have those, too; there are places where\nthey are a good deal more convenient than the `(P)\\' flag.\nA more powerful flag is (e), which forces the value to be rescanned\nfor all forms of single-word substitution. For example,\n  % foo='$(print $ZSH_VERSION)'\n  % print ${(e)foo}\n  4.0.2\nmade the value of $foo be re-examined, at which point the command\nsubstitution was found and executed.\nThe remaining flags are a few simple special formatting tricks: order\narray elements in normal lexical (character) order with (o), order in\nreverse order with (O), do the same case-independently with (oi) or\n(Oi) respectively, expand prompt `%\\'-escapes with (%) (easy to\nremember), expand backslash escapes as print does with p, force all\ncharacters to uppercase with (U) or lowercase with (L), capitalise\nthe first character of the string or each array element with (C), show\nup special characters as escape sequences with (V). That should be\nenough to be getting on with.\n[]{#l127}\n5.4.7: A couple of parameter substitution tricks\nI can\\'t resist describing a couple of extras.\nZsh can do so much on parameter expressions that sometimes it\\'s useful\neven without a parameter! For example, here\\'s how to get the length of\na fixed string without needing to put it into a parameter:\n  % print ${#:-abcdefghijklm}\n  13\nIf the parameter whose name you haven\\'t given has a zero length (it\ndoes, because there isn\\'t one), use the string after the `:-\\'\ninstead, and take it\\'s length. Note you need the colon, else you are\nasking the shell to test whether a parameter is set, and it becomes\nrather upset when it realises there isn\\'t one to test. Other shells are\nunlikely to tolerate any such syntactic outrages at all; the # in that\ncase is likely to be treated as $#, the number of shell arguments. But\nzsh knows that\\'s not going to have zero length, and assumes you know\nwhat you\\'re doing with the extra part; this is useful, but technically\na violation of the rules.\nSometimes you don\\'t need anything more than the flags. The most useful\ncase is making the `fill\\' flags generate repeated words, with the\neffect of perl\\'s `x\\' operator (for those not familiar with perl,\nthe expression `\"string\" x 3\\' produces the string\n`stringstringstring\\'. Here, you need to remember that the fill width\nyou specify is the total width, not the number of repetitions, so you\nneed to multiply it by the length of the string:\n  % print ${(l.18..string.)}\n  stringstringstring\n[]{#l128}\n5.4.8: Nested parameter substitutions\nZsh has a system for multiple nested parameter substitutions. Whereas in\nmost shells or other scripting languages you would do something like:\n  % p=/directory/file.ext\n  % p2=${p##*/}            # remove longest match of */ from head\n  % print $p2\n  file.ext\n  % print ${p%.*}          # remove shortest match of .* from tail\n  file\nin zsh you can do this in one substitution:\n  % p=/directory/file.ext\n  % print ${${p##*/}%.*}\n  file\nsaving the temporary parameter in the middle. (Again, you are more\nlikely to use ${p:t:r} in this particular case.) Where this becomes a\nmajor advantage is with arrays: if $p is an array, all the\nsubstitutions are applied to every element of the array:\n  % p=(/dir1/file1.ext1 /dir2/file2.ext2)\n  % print ${${p##*/}%.*}\n  file1 file2\nThis can result in some considerable reductions in the code for\nprocessing arrays. It\\'s a way of getting round the fact that an\nordinary command line interface like zsh, designed originally for direct\ninteraction with the user, doesn\\'t have all the sophistication of a\nnon-interactive language like perl, whose `map\\' function would\nprobably be the neatest way of doing the same thing:\n   # Perl code.\n   @p = qw(/dir1/file1.ext1 /dir2/file2.ext2);\n   @q = map { m%^(?:.*/)(.*?)(?:\\.[^.]*|)$%; } @p;\n   print \"@q\\n\";'\nor numerous possible variants. In a shell, there\\'s no way of putting\nfunctions like that into the command line without complicating the basic\n`command, arguments\\' syntax; so we resort to trickery with\nsubstitutions. Note, however, that this degree of brevity makes for a\ncertain lack of readability even in Perl. Furthermore, zsh is so\noptimised for common cases that\n  print ${p:t:r}\nwill work for both arrays and scalars: the :t takes only the tail of\nthe filename, stripping the directories, and the :r removes the\nsuffix. These two operators could have slightly unexpected effects in\nversions of zsh before 4.0.1, removing `suffixes\\' which contained\ndirectory paths, for example (though this is what the pattern forms\ntaken separately do, too).\nNote one feature of the nested substitution: you might have expected the\n`${...}\\' inside the other one to do a full parameter substitution,\nso that the outer one would act on the value of that --- that\\'s what\nyou\\'d get if the substitution was on its own, after all. However,\nthat\\'s not what happens: the `${...}\\' inside is simply a syntactic\ntrick to say `here come more operations on the parameter\\'. This means\nthat\n  bar='this doesn'\\''t get substituted'\n  foo='bar'\n  print ${${foo}}\nsimply prints `bar\\', not the value of $bar. This is the same case\nwe had before but without any of the extra `##\\' and `%\\' bits.\nThe reason is historical: when the extremely useful nested substitution\nfeature was added, it was much simpler to have the leading `$\\'\nindicate to the shell that it should call the substitution function\nagain than find another syntax. You can make the value be re-interpreted\nas another parameter substitution, using the (P) substitution flag\ndescribed above. Just remember that ${${foo}} and ${(P)foo} are\ndifferent.\n[]{#l129}\n5.5: That substitution again\nFinally, here is a brief explanation of how to read the expression at\nthe top of the chapter. This is for advanced students only (nutcases, if\nyou ask me). You can find all the bits in the manual, if you try hard\nenough, even the ones I didn\\'t get around to explaining above. As an\nexample, let\\'s suppose the array contains\n  array=(long longer longest short brief)\nand see what\n  print ${array[(r)${(l.${#${(O@)array//?/X}[1]}..?.)}]}\ngives.\n\nAlways start from the inside. The innermost expression here is\n    ${(O@)array//?/X}\nNot much clearer? Start from the inside again: there\\'s the\nparameter we\\'re operating on, whose name is array. Before that\nthere are two flags in parenthesis: (O) says sort the result in\ndescending alphabetic order, (@) treat the result as an array,\nwhich is necessary because this inner substitution occurs where a\nscalar value (actually, an arithmetic expression) would usually\noccur, and we need to take an array element. After the array name,\n`//?/X\\' is a global substitution: take the pattern `?\\' (any\ncharacter) wherever it occurs, and replace it with the string\n`X\\'. The result of this is an array like $array, but with all\nthe elements turned into strings consisting of `X\\'s in place of\nthe original characters, and with the longest first, because that\\'s\nhow reverse alphabetic order works for strings with the same\ncharacter. So\n    long longer longest short brief\nwould have become\n    XXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXX\n\nNext, we have `${#result[1]}\\' wrapped around that. That\nmeans that we take the first element of the array we arrived at\nabove (the `[1]\\': that\\'s why we had to make sure it was treated\nas an array), and then take the length of that (the `#\\'). We\nwill end up in this case with 7, the length of the first (and\nlongest element). We\\'re finally getting somewhere.\n\nThe next step is the `${(l.result..?.)}\\'. Our previous\nresult appears as an argument to the `(l)\\' flag of the\nsubstitution. That\\'s a rather special case of nested substitution:\nat this point, the shell expects an arithmetical expression, giving\nthe minimum length of a string to be filled on the left. The\nprevious substitution was evaluated because arithmetic expressions\nundergo parameter substitution. So it is the result of that, 7,\nwhich appears here, giving the more manageable\n    ${(l.7..?.)}\nThe expression for the `(l)\\' flag in full says `fill the result\nof this parameter substitution to a minimum width of 7 using the\nfill character `?\\'. What is the substitution we are filling?\nIt\\'s empty: zsh is smart enough to assume you know what you\\'re\ndoing when you don\\'t give a parameter name, and just puts in an\nempty string instead. So the empty string is filled out to length 7\nwith question marks, giving `???????\\'.\n\nNow we have `${array[(r)???????]}\\'. It may not be obvious\n(congratulations if the rest is), but the question marks are active\nas a pattern. Subscripts are treated specially in this respect. The\nsubscript flag `(r)\\' means `reverse match\\', not reverse as in\nbackwards, but as in the opposite way round: search the array itself\nfor a matching value, rather than taking this as an index. The only\nthing that will match this is a string of length 7. Bingo! that must\nbe the element `longest\\' in this case. If there were other\nelements of the same length, you would only get the first of that\nlength; I haven\\'t thought of a way of getting all the elements of\nthat length substituted by a single expression without turning\n$array into an associative array, so if you have, you should feel\nsmug.\n\n\nAfter I wrote this, Sven Wischnowsky (who is responsible for a large\nfraction of the similar hieroglyphics in the completion functions)\npointed out that a similar way of achieving this is:\n  print ${(M)array:#${~${(O@)array//?/?}[1]}}\nwhich does indeed show all the elements of the maximum length. A brief\nsummary of how this works is that the innermost expression produces an\narray of `?\\' corresponding to the elements, longest first in the way\nwe did above, turning the `?\\' into pattern match characters. The\nnext expansion picks the longest. Finally, the outermost expansion goes\nthrough $array to find elements which match the complete string of\n`?\\' and selects out those that do match.\nIf you are wondering about how to do that in perl in a single\nexpression, probably sorting on length is the easiest:\n  # Perl code\n  @array = qw(long longer longest short brief);\n  @array = sort { length $b  length $a } @array;\nand taking out the first element or first few elements of @array.\nHowever, in a highly-optimized scripting language you would almost\ncertainly do it some other way: for example, avoid sorting and just\nremember the longest element:\n  # Perl code\n  $elt = '';\n  $l = 0;\n  foreach (@array) {\n    $newl = length $_;\n    $elt = $_, $l = $newl  if $l > $newl;\n  }\n  print $elt, \"\\n\";\nYou can do just the same thing in zsh easily enough in this case;\n  local val elt\n  integer l newl\n  for val in $array; do\n    newl=${#val}\n    if (( newl > l )); then\n      elt=$val\n      (( l = newl ))\n    fi\n  done\n  print $elt\nso this probably isn\\'t a particularly good use for nested substitution,\neven though it illustrates its power.\nIf you enjoyed that expression, there are many more like it in the\ncompletion function suite for you to goggle at.\n[]{#l130}\n5.6: Arithmetic Expansion\nPerforming mathematics within the shell was first described in chapter\n3 where I showed how to create numeric\nparameters with variants of `typeset\\', and said a little about\narithmetic substitution.\nIn addition to the math library, loadable with\n`zmodload zsh/mathfunc\\', zsh has essentially all the operators you\nexpect from C and other languages derived from it. In other words,\nthings like\n  (( foo = bar ? 3 : 1, ++brr ))\nare accepted. The comma operator works just as in C; all the arguments\nare evaluated, in this case `foo = bar ? 3 : 1\\' assigns 3 or 1 to\n$foo depending whether or not bar is non-zero, and then $brr is\nincremented by 1. The return status is determined by the final\nexpression, so if $brr is zero after increment the return status is\none, else it is zero (integers may be negative).\nOne extra operator has been borrowed from FORTRAN, or maybe Perl, the\nexponentiation operator, `**\\'. This can take either integers or\nfloating point numbers, though a negative exponent will cause a floating\npoint number to be returned, so `$(( 2 ** -1 ))\\' gives you 0.5, not\nrounded down to zero. This is why the standard library function pow is\nmissing from zsh/mathfunc --- it\\'s already there in that other\nform. Pure integer exponentiation, however, is done by repeated\nmultiplication --- up to arbitrary sizes, so instead of\n`2 ** 100\\', you should use `1 \\', and for powers of any\nother integer where you don\\'t need an exact result, you should use\nfloating point numbers. For this purpose, the zsh/mathfunc library\nmakes `casts\\' available; `float(num)\\' forces the expression\nnum to interpreted as a floating point number, whatever it would\notherwise have given, although the trick of adding `0.0\\' to a number\nworks as well. Note that, although this works like a cast in C, the\nsyntax is that of an ordinary function call. Likewise, `int(num)\\'\ncauses the number to be interpreted as an integer --- rounding towards\nzero; you can use floor and ceil to round down or up, and rint to\nround to the nearest integer, although these three actually produce\nfloating point numbers. They are standard C library functions.\nFor completeness, the assignment form of exponentiation `**=\\' also\nworks. I can\\'t remember ever using it.\nThe range of integers depends on how zsh was configured on your machine.\nThe primary goal is to make sure integers are large enough to represent\nindexes into files; on some systems where the hardware usually deals\nwith 32-bit integers, file sizes may be given by 64-bit integers, and\nzsh will try to use 64-bit integers as well. However, zsh will test for\nlarge integers even if no large file support is available; usually it\njust requires that your compiler has some easy to recognise way of\ndefining 64-bit integers, such as `long long\\' which may be handled\nby gcc even if it isn\\'t by the native compiler. You can easily test; if\nyour zsh supports 64-bit integers, the largest available integer is:\n  % print $(( 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF ))\n  9223372036854775807\nand if you try adding something positive to that, you will get a\nnegative result due to two\\'s complement arithmetic. This should be\nlarge enough to count most things.\nThe range of floating point numbers is always that of a C `double\\',\nwhich is usually also 64 bits, and internally the number is highly\nlikely to be in the IEEE standard form, which also affects the precision\nand range you can get, though that\\'s system specific, too. On most\nsystems, the math library functions handle doubles rather than single\nprecision floats, so this is the natural choice. The cast function is\ncalled `float\\' because, unlike C, the representation of a floating\npoint number is chosen for you, so the generic name is used.\n[]{#l131}\n5.6.1: Entering and outputting bases\nI\\'ll say a word or two about bases. I already said you could enter a\nnumber with any small base in a form like `2#101010\\' or\n`16#ffff\\', and that the latter could also be `0xffff\\' as in C.\nYou can\\'t, however, enter octal numbers just by using a leading\n`0\\', which you might expect from C. Here\\'s an example of why not.\nLet\\'s set:\n  % foo=${(%):-%D}\n  % print $foo\n  01-08-06\nThe first line is another of those bogus parameter substitutions where\nwe gave it a literal string and a blank parameter. We also gave it the\nflag `(%)\\', which forces prompt escapes to be expanded, and in\nprompts `(%D)\\' is the date as yy-mm-dd. Let\\'s write a short\nprogram to find out what the date after $foo is. We have the luxury of\n99 years to worry about the century wrapping, so we\\'ll ignore it (and\nthe Gregorian calendar).\n  mlens=(31 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31)\n  date=(${(s.-.)foo})    #  splits to array (01 08 23)\n  typeset -Z 2 incr\n  if (( ${date[3]} This will print `01-08-07\\'. Before I get to the point, various other\nexplanations. We forced $foo to be split on any `-\\' in it, giving\na three-part array. The next trick was `typeset -Z 2 incr\\', which\ntells the shell that $incr is to be at least two characters, filled\nwith leading zeroes. That\\'s how we got the `07\\' at the end, instead\nof just `7\\'. There\\'s another way of doing this: replace\n  typeset -Z 2 incr\n  (( incr = ${date[2]} + 1 ))\n  date[2]=$incr\nwith:\n  date[2]=${(l.2..0.)$(( ${date[2]} + 1 ))}\nThis uses the (l) parameter flag to fill up to two characters with a\nzero (the default is a space, so we need to specify the `0\\' this\ntime), using the fact that parameter operations can have a nested\n$-substution. This second form is less standard, however.\nNow, finally, the point. In that `$(( ${date[2]} + 1 ))\\', the\n`${date[2]}\\' is simply the scalar `08\\' --- the result of\nsplitting an arbitrary string into an array. Suppose we used leading\nzeroes to signify octal numbers. We would get something like:\n  % print $(( ${date[2]} + 1 ))\n  zsh: bad math expression: operator expected at `8 + 1 '\nbecause the expression in the substitution becomes `08 + 1\\' and an 8\ncan\\'t appear in an octal number. So we would have to strip off any\notherwise harmless leading zeroes. Parsing dates, or indeed strings with\nleading zeroes as padding, is a fairly common thing for a shell to do,\nand octal arithmetic isn\\'t. So by default leading zeroes don\\'t have\nthat effect.\nHowever, there is an option you can set, OCTAL_ZEROES; this is\nrequired for compatibility with the POSIX standard. That\\'s how I got\nthe error message in the previous paragraph, in fact.\nFloating point numbers are never octal, always decimal:\n  % setopt octalzeroes\n  % print $(( 077 ))\n  63\n  % print $(( 077.43 ))\n  77.430000000000007\nThe other option to do with bases is C_BASES, which makes hexadecimal\n(and, if you have OCTAL_ZEROES set, octal) numbers appear in the form\nthat you would use as input to a C (or, once again, Perl) program.\nHow do you persuade the shell to print out numbers in a particular base\nanyway? There are two ways. The first is to associate a base with a\nparameter, which you do with an argument after the `-i\\' option to\ntypeset:\n  % typeset -i 16 hexnum=32\n  % print $hexnum\n  16#20\nThis is the standard way. By the way, there\\'s a slight catch with\nbases, taken over from ksh: if you don\\'t specify a base, the first\nassignment will do the job for you.\n  % integer anynum\n  % (( anynum = 16#20 ))\n  % print $anynum\n  16#20\nOnly constants with explicit bases in an expression produce this effect;\nthe first time `anynum\\' comes into contact with a\n`base#num\\', or a hexadecimal or (where applicable) octal\nexpression in the standard C form, it will acquire a default output\nbase. So you need to use `typeset -i 10\\' if you don\\'t like that.\nOften, however, you just want to print out an expression in, say,\nhexadecimal. Zsh has a shorthand for this, which is only in recent\nversions (and not in other shells). Preceding an expression by\n`[#base]\\' causes the default output base to be set to base\nwith the the usual prefix showing the base, and `[##base]\\' will\ndo the same but without the prefix, i.e. `$(( [##16]255 ))\\' is\nsimply `FF\\'. This has no effect on assignments to a parameter, not\neven on the parameter\\'s default output base, but it will affect the\nresult of a direct substitution using $((...)).\n[]{#l132}\n5.6.2: Parameter typing\nJust as creating a parameter with an ordinary assignment makes it a\nscalar, so creating it in an arithmetic substitution makes it either an\ninteger or a floating point parameter, according to the value assigned.\nThis is likely to be a floating point number if there was a floating\npoint number in the expression on the right hand side, and an integer\notherwise. However, there are reasons why a floating point number on the\nright may not have this effect --- use of int, for example, since it\nproduces an integer.\nHowever, relying on implicit typing in this fashion is bad. One of the\nreasons is explained in the manual entry, and I can\\'t do better than\nuse that example (since I wrote it):\n  for (( f = 0; f If you try this, and $f does not already exist, you will see an\nendless stream of zeroes. What\\'s happening is that the original\nassignment creates $f as an integer to store the integer 0 in. After\nprinting this, $f is incremented by adding 0.1 to it. But once\ncreated, $f remains an integer, so the resulting 0.1 is cast back to\nan integer, and the resulting zero is stored back in $f. The result is\nthat $f is never incremented.\nYou could turn the first 0 into 0.0, but a better way is to declare\n`float f\\' before the loop. In a function, this also ensures $f is\nlocal to the function.\nIf you use a scalar to store an integer or floating point, everything\nwill work. You don\\'t have the problem just described, since although\n$f contains what looks like an integer to start with, it has no\nnumeric type associated with it, and when you store 0.1 into $f, it\nwill happily overwrite the string `0\\'. It\\'s a bit more inefficient\nto use scalars, but actually not that much. You can\\'t specify an output\nbase or precision, and in versions of zsh up to 4.0.x, there is a\nproblem when the parameter already has a string in it which doesn\\'t\nmake sense as a numeric expression:\n  % foo='/file/name'\n  % (( foo = 3 ))\n  zsh: bad math expression: operand expected at `/file/name'\nThe unexpected error comes because `/file/name/\\' is evaluated even\nthough the shell is about to overwrite the contents of $foo. Versions\nof the shell from 4.1.1 have a fix for this, and the integer assignment\nworks as expected.\nYou need to be careful with scalars that might contain an empty string.\nIf you declare `integer i\\', it will immediately contain the value 0,\nbut if you declare `typeset s\\', the scalar $s will just contain\nthe empty string. You get away with this if you use the parameter\nwithout a `$\\' in front:\n  % typeset s\n  % print $(( 3 * s ))\n  0\nbecause the math code tries to retrieve $s, and when it fails puts a\n0 there. However, if you explicitly use $s, the math code gets\nconfused:\n  % print $(( 3 * $s ))\n  zsh: bad math expression: operand expected at `'\nbecause `$s\\' evaluates to an empty string before the arithmetic\nevaluation proper, which spoils the syntax. There\\'s one common case\nwhere you need to do that, and that\\'s with positional parameters:\n  % fn() { print \"Twice $1 is $(( 2 * $1 ))\"; }\n  % fn 3\n  Twice 3 is 6\n  % fn\n  fn: bad math expression: operand expected at `'\nObviously turning the `$1\\' into `1\\' means something completely\ndifferent. You can guard against this with default values:\n  % fn() { print \"Twice ${1:=0} is $(( 2 * $1 ))\"; }\n  % fn\n  Twice 0 is 0\nThis assigns a default value for $0 if one was not set. Since\nparameter expansion is performed in one go from left to right, the\nsecond reference to $1 will pick up that value.\nNote that you need to do this even if it doesn\\'t look like the number\nwill be needed:\n  % fn() { print $(( ${1:-0} ? $1 : 3 )); }\n  % fn\n  fn: bad math expression: operand expected at `: 3 '\nThe expression before the `?\\' evaluates to zero if $1 is not\npresent, and you expect the expression after the colon to be used in\nthat case. But actually it\\'s too late by then; the arithmetic\nexpression parser has received `0 ? : 3\\', which doesn\\'t make sense\nto it, hence the error. So you need to put in `${1:-0}\\' for the\nsecond $1, too --- or ${1:-32}, or any other number, since it\nwon\\'t be evaluated if $1 is empty, it just needs to be parsed.\nYou should note that just as you can put numbers into scalar parameters\nwithout needing any special handling, you can also do all the usual\nstring-related tricks on numeric parameters, since there is automatic\nconversion in the other direction, too:\n  % float foo\n  % zmodload -i zsh/mathfunc\n  % (( foo = 4 * atan(1.0) ))\n  % print $foo\n  3.141592654e+00\n  % print ${foo%%.*}${foo##*.[0-9]##}\n  3e+00\nThe argument -i to zmodload tells it not to complain if the math\nlibrary is already loaded. This gives us access to atan. Remember,\n`float\\' declares a parameter whose output includes an exponent ---\nyou can actually convert it to a fixed point format on the fly using\n`typeset -F foo\\', which retains the value but alters the output\ntype. The substitution uses some EXTENDED_GLOB chicanery: the final\n`[0-9]##\\' matches one or more occurrences of any decimal digit. So\nthe head of the string value of $foo up to the last digit after the\ndecimal point is removed, and the remainder appended to whatever appears\nbefore the decimal point.\nStarting from 4.1.1, a calculator function called zcalc is bundled\nwith the shell. You type a standard arithmetic expression and the shell\nevaluates the formula and prints it out. Lines already entered are\nprefixed by a number, and you can use the positional parameter\ncorresponding to that number to retrieve that result for use in a new\nformula. The function uses vared to read the formulae, so the full\nshell editing mechanism is available. It will also read in\nzsh/mathfunc if that is present.\n[]{#l133}\n5.7: Brace Expansion and Arrays\nBrace expansion, which you met in chapter 3,\nappears in all csh derivatives, in some versions of ksh, and in bash, so\nis fairly standard. However, there are some features and aspects of it\nwhich are only found in zsh, which I\\'ll describe here.\nA complication occurs when arrays are involved. Normally, unquoted\narrays are put into a command line as if there is a break between\narguments when there is a new element, so\n  % array=(three separate words)\n  % print -l before${array}after\n  beforethree\n  separate\n  wordsafter\nunless the RC_EXPAND_PARAM option is set, which combines the before\nand after parts with each element, so you get:\n  % print -l before${^array}after\n  beforethreeafter\n  beforeseparateafter\n  beforewordsafter\n--- the `^\\' character turns on the option just for that expansion,\nas `=\\' does with SH_WORD_SPLIT. If you think of the character as a\ncorrection to a proof, meaning `insert a new word between the others\nhere\\', it might help you remember (this was suggested by Bart\nSchaefer).\nThese two ways of expanding arrays interact differently with braces; the\nmore useful version here is when the RC_EXPAND_PARAM option is on.\nHere the array acts as sort of additional nesting:\n  % array=(two three)\n  % print X{one,${^array}}Y\n  XoneY XtwoY XoneY XthreeY\nwith the XoneY tacked on each time, but because of the braces it\nappears as a separate word, so there are four altogether.\nIf RC_EXPAND_PARAM is not set, you get something at first sight\nslightly odd:\n  % array=(two three)\n  % print X{one,$array}Y\n  X{one,two three}Y\nWhat has happened here is that the $array has produced two words; the\nfirst has `X{one,\\' tacked in front of the array\\'s `two\\', while\nthe second likewise has `}Y\\' on the end of the array\\'s `three\\'.\nSo by the time the shell comes to think about brace expansion, the\nbraces are in different words and don\\'t do anything useful.\nThere\\'s no obvious simple way of forcing the $array to be embedded in\nthe braces at the same level, instead of like an additional set of\nbraces. There are more complicated ways, of course.\n  % array=(two three)\n  % print X${^=:-one $array}Y\n  XoneY XtwoY XthreeY\nYuk. We gave parameter substitution a string of words, the array with\none stuck in front, and told it to split them on spaces (this will\nsplit on any extra spaces in elements of $array, unfortunately), while\nsetting RC_EXPAND_PARAM. The parameter flags are `^=\\'; the\n`:-\\' is the usual `insert the following if the substitution has\nzero length\\' operator. It\\'s probably better just to create your own\ntemporary array and apply RX_EXPAND_PARAM to that. By the way, if you\nhad RC_EXPAND_PARAM set already, the last result would have been\ndifferent becuase the embedded $array would have been expanded\ntogether with the `one\\' in front of it.\nBraces allow numeric expressions; this works a little like in Perl:\n  % print {1..10}a\n  1a 2a 3a 4a 5a 6a 7a 8a 9a 10a\nand you can ask the numbers to be padded with zeroes:\n  % print {01..10}b\n  01b 02b 03b 04b 05b 06b 07b 08b 09b 10b\nor have them in descending order:\n  % print {10..1}c\n  10c 9c 8c 7c 6c 5c 4c 3c 2c 1c\nNesting this within other braces works in the expected way, but you\ncan\\'t have any extra braces inside: the syntax is fixed to number, two\ndots, number, and the numbers must be positive.\nThere\\'s also an option BRACE_CCL which, if the braces aren\\'t in\neither of the above forms, expands single letters and ranges of letters:\n  % setopt braceccl\n  % print 1{abw-z}2\n  1a2 1b2 1w2 1x2 1y2 1z2\nAn important point to be made about braces is that they are not part\nof filename generation; they have nothing to do with pattern matching at\nall. The shell blindly generates all the arguments you specify. If you\nwant to generate only some arguments, depending on what files are\nmatched, you should use the alternative-match syntax. Compare:\n  % ls\n  file1\n  % print file(1|2)\n  file1\n  % print file{1,2}\n  file1 file2\nThe first matches any of `file1\\' or `file2\\' it happens to find\nin the directory (regardless of other files). The second doesn\\'t look\nat files in the directory at all; it simply expands the braces according\nto the rules given above.\nThis point is particularly worthy of note if you have come from a\nC-shell world, or use the CSH_NULL_GLOB option:\n  csh% echo file{1,2}\n  file1 file2\n  csh% echo f*{1,2}\n  file1\n(`csh%\\' is the prompt, to remind you if you\\'re skipping through\nwithout reading the text), where the difference occurs because in the\nfirst case there was no pattern, so brace expansion was done on ordinary\nwords, while in the second case the `*\\' made pattern expansion\nhappen. In zsh, the sequence would be: `f*{1,2}\\' becomes\n`f*1 f*2\\'; the first becomes file1 and the second fails to match.\nWith CSH_NULL_GLOB set, the failed match is simply removed; there is\nno error because one pattern has succeeded in matching. This is\npresumably the logic usually followed by the C shell. If you stick with\n`file(1|2)\\' and `f*(1|2)\\' --- in this case you can simplify\nthem to `file[12]\\' and `f*[12]\\', but that\\'s not true if you\nhave more than one character in either branch --- you are protected\nfrom this difference.\n[]{#l134}\n5.8: Filename Expansion\nFilename expansions consists of just `~/...\\', `~user/...\\',\n`~namedir/...\\' and `=prog\\', where the `~\\' and `=\\' must\nbe the first character of a word, and the option EQUALS must be set\n(it is by default) for the `=\\' to be special. I told you about all\nthis in chapter 3.\nThere\\'s really only one thing to add, and that\\'s the behaviour of the\nMAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST option. Assignments after typeset and similar\nstatements are handled as follows\n  % typeset foo=~pws\n  % print $foo\n  /home/pws\n  % typeset PATH=$PATH:~pws/bin\n  % print ${path[-1]}\n  /home/pws/bin\nIt may not be obvious why this is not obvious. The point is that\n`typeset\\' is an ordinary command which happens to be a shell\nbuiltin; the arguments of ordinary commands are not assignments.\nHowever, a special case is made here for typeset and its friends so\nthat this works, even though, as I\\'ve said repeatedly, array\nassignments can\\'t be done after typeset. The parameter $PATH isn\\'t\nhandled differently from any other --- any colon in an assignment to\nany variable is special in the way shown.\nIt\\'s often useful to have this feature with commands of your own. There\nis an option, MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST, which spots the forms `...=~...\\'\nand `...=...:~...\\' for any command at all and expands\n~-expressions. Commands where this is particularly useful include\nmake and the GNU configure command used for setting up the\ncompilation of a software package from scratch.\nA related new option appeared in version 4.0.2 when it became clear\nthere was an annoying difference between zsh and other shells such as\nksh and bash. Consider:\n  export FOO=`echo hello there`\nIn ksh and bash, this exports $foo with the value `hello there\\'.\nIn zsh, however, an unquoted backquote expression forces wordsplitting,\nso the line becomes\n  export FOO=hello there\nand exports $FOO with the value `hello\\', and $there with any\nvalue it happens to have already or none if it didn\\'t exist. This is\nactually perfectly logical according to the rules, but you can set the\noption KSH_TYPESET to have the other interpretation.\nNormally, KSH_TYPESET applies only after parameter declaration\nbuiltins, and then only in the values of an assignment. However, in\ncombination with MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST, you will get the same behaviour\nwith any command argument that looks like an assignment --- actually,\nanything following an `=\\' which wasn\\'t at the start of the word, so\n`\"hello mother, => I'm home \"$(echo right now)\\' qualifies.\nIt seems that bash behaves as if both KSH_TYPESET and\nMAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST are always in effect.\n[]{#l135}\n5.9: Filename Generation and Pattern Matching\nThe final topic is perhaps the biggest, even richer than parameter\nexpansion. I\\'m finally going to explain the wonderful world of zsh\npattern matching. In addition to patterns as such, you will learn such\nthings as how to find all files in all subdirectories, searching\nrecursively, which have a given name, case insensitive, are at least 50\nKB large, no more than a week old and owned by the root user, and\nallowing up to a single error in the spelling of the name. In fact, the\nrequired expression looks like this:\n  **/(#ia1)name(LK+50mw-1u0)\nwhich might appear, at first sight, a mite impenetrable. We\\'ll work up\nto it gradually.\nTo repeat: filename generation is just the same as globbing, only\nlonger. I use the terms interchangeably.\n[]{#l136}\n5.9.1: Comparing patterns and regular expressions\nIt can be confusing that there are two rather different sorts of pattern\naround, those used for matching files on a command line as in zsh and\nother shells, and those used for matching text inside files as in\ngrep, sed, emacs, perl and many other utilities, each of which,\ntypically, has a slightly different form for patterns (called in this\ncase `regular expressions\\', because UNIX was designed by computer\nscientists). There are even some utilities like TCL which provide both\nforms.\nZsh deals exclusively with the shell form, which I\\'ve been calling by\nits colloquial name, `globbing\\', and consequently I won\\'t talk about\nregular expressions in any detail. Here are the two classic differences\nto note. First, in a shell, `*\\' on its own matches any set of\ncharacters, while in a regular expression it always refers to the\nprevious pattern, and says that that can be repeated any number of\ntimes. Second, in a shell `.\\' is an ordinary (and much used)\ncharacter, while in a regular expression it means `any character\\',\nwhich is specified by `?\\' in the shell. Put this together, and what\na shell calls `*\\' is given by `.*\\' in a regular expression.\n`*\\' in the latter case is called a `Kleene closure\\': it\\'s those\ncomputer scientists again. In zsh, art rather than science tends to be\nin evidence.\nIn fact, zsh does have many of the features available in regular\nexpressions, as well as some which aren\\'t. Remember that anywhere in\nzsh where you need a pattern, it\\'s of the same form, whether it\\'s\nmatching files on the command line or a string in a case statement.\nThere are a few features which only fit well into one or another use of\npatterns; for example the feature that selects files by examining their\ntype, owner, age, etc. (the final parenthesis in the expression I showed\nabove) are no use in matching against a string.\n[]{#l137}\n5.9.2: Standard features\nThere is one thing to note about the simple pattern matching features\n`*\\' and `?\\', which is that when matching file names (not in\nother places patterns are used, however) they never match a leading\n`.\\'. This is a convention in UNIX-like systems to hide certain files\nwhich are not interesting to most users. You may have got the impression\nthat files begining with `.\\' are somehow special, but that\\'s not\nso; only the files `.\\' (the current directory) and `..\\' (the\nparent directory, or the current directory in /) are special to the\nsystem. Other files beginning with `.\\' only appear special because\nof a conspiracy between the shell (the rule I\\'ve just given) and the\ncommand ls, which, when it lists a directory, doesn\\'t show files\nbeginning `.\\' unless you give the `-a\\' option. Otherwise\n`.\\'-files are perfectly normal files.\nYou can suppress the special rule for an initial `.\\' by setting the\noption GLOB_DOTS, in which case `*\\' will match every single file\nand directory except for `.\\' and `..\\'.\nIn addition to `*\\' and `?\\', which are so basic that even DOS had\nthem (though I never quite worked out exactly what it was doing with\nthem a lot of the time), the pattern consisting of a set of characters\nin square brackets appears in all shells. This feature happens to be\npretty much the same as in regular expressions. `[abc]\\' matches any\none of those three characters; `[a-z]\\' matches any character between\na and z, inclusive; `[^a-z]\\' matches any single character\nexcept those 26 --- but notice it still matches a single character.\nA recent common enhancement to character ranges features in zsh, which\nis to specify types of characters instead of listing them; I\\'m just\nrepeating the manual entry here, which you should consult for more\ndetail. The special syntax is like `[:spec:]\\', where the square\nbrackets there are in addition to the ones specifying the range. If you\nare familiar with the `ctype\\' macros use in C programmes, you will\nprobably recognise the things that spec can be: alnum, alpha,\nblank, cntrl, digit, graph, lower, print, punct, space,\nupper, xdigit. The similarity to C macros isn\\'t just for show: the\nshell really does call the macro (or function) `isalpha\\' to test for\n[:alpha:]ness, and so on. On most modern systems which support\ninternationalization this means the shell can tell you whether a\ncharacter is, say, an alphabetic letter in the character set in use on\nyour machine. By the way, zsh doesn\\'t use international character set\nsupport for sorting matches --- this turned out to produce too many\nunexpected effects.\nSo `[^[:digit:]]\\' matches any single character other than a decimal\ndigit. Standards say you should use `!\\' instead of `^\\' to\nsignify negation, but most people I know don\\'t; also, this can clash\nwith history substitution. However, it is accepted by zsh anywhere where\nhistory substitution doesn\\'t get its hands on the `!\\' first (which\nincludes all scripts and autoloaded functions).\n[]{#l138}\n5.9.3: Extensions usually available\nNow we reach the bits specific to zsh. I\\'ve divided these into two\nparts, since some require the option `EXTENDED_GLOB\\' to be set ---\nthose which are most likely to clash with other uses of the characters\nin question.\nNumeric ranges\\\nOne possibility that is always available is the syntax for numeric\nranges in the form `num1-num2>\\'. You can omit either\nnum1, which defaults to zero, or num2, which defaults to infinity,\nor both, in which case any set of digits will be matched. Note that this\nreally does mean infinity, despite the finite range of integers;\nmissing out num2 is treated as a special case and the shell will\nsimply advance over any number of digits. (In very old versions of zsh\nyou had to use `<>\\' to get that effect, but that has been removed\nand `<>\\' is now a redirection operator, as in other shells;\n`\\' is what you need for any set of digits.)\nI repeat another warning from the manual: this test\n  [[ 342 = * ]]\nsucceeds, even though the number isn\\'t in the range 1 to 30. That\\'s\nbecause `\\' matches `3\\' and `*\\' matches 42. There\\'s no\nuse moaning, it\\'s a consequence of the usual rule for patterns of all\ntypes in shells or utilities: pattern operators are tried independently,\nand each `uses up\\' the longest piece of the string it is matching\nwithout causing the rest of the match to fail. We would have to break\nthis simple and well-tried rule to stop numeric ranges matching if there\nis another digit left. You can test for that yourself, of course:\n  [[ 342 = (|[^[:digit:]]*) ]]\nfails. I wrote it so that it would match any number between 1 and 30,\neither not followed by anything, or followed by something which doesn\\'t\nstart with a digit; I will explain what the parentheses and the vertical\nbar are doing in the next section. By the way, leading zeroes are\ncorrectly handled (and never force octal interpretation); so\n`00000003NaN\\' would successfully match the pattern.\nThe numbers in the range are always positive integers; you need extra\npattern trickery to match floating point. Here\\'s one attempt, which\nuses EXTENDED_GLOB operators, so come back and look when you\\'ve read\nthe rest of this section if it doesn\\'t make sense now:\n  isfloat() {\n    setopt localoptions extendedglob\n    if [[ $1 = ([-+]|)([0-9]##.[0-9]#|[0-9]#.[0-9]##)\\ \n([eE]([-+]|)[0-9]##|) ]]; then\n      print -r -- \"$1 is a floating point number\"\n    else\n      print -r -- \"$1 is not a floating point number\"\n    fi\n  }\nI\\'ve split it over two lines to fit. The first parenthesis matches an\noptional minus or plus sign --- careful with `-\\' in square\nbrackets, since if it occurs in the middle it\\'s taken as a range, and\nif you want it to match itself, it has to be at the start or end. The\nsecond parenthesis contains an alternative because `.\\' isn\\'t a\nfloating point number (at least, not in my book, and not in zsh\\'s,\neither), but both `0.\\' and `.0\\' are properly formed numbers.\nSo we need at least one digit, either before or after the decimal point;\nthe `##\\' means `at least one occurrence of the previous\nexpression\\', while the `#\\' means `zero or more occurrences of the\nprevious expression\\'. The expresion on the next line matches an\nexponent; here you need at least one digit, too. So `3.14159E+00\\' is\nsuccessfully matched, and indeed you\\'ll find that zsh\\'s arithmetic\noperations handle it properly.\nThe range operator is the only special zsh operator that you can\\'t turn\noff with an option. This is usually not a problem, but in principle a\nstring like `\\' is ambiguous, since in another shell it would\nbe read as `\\', meaning `take input from file 3-10, and\nsend output to the file formed by whatever comes after the expression\\'.\nIt\\'s very unlikely you will run across this in practice, however, since\nshell code writers nearly alwys put a space after the end of a file name\nfor redirection if something else follows on the command line, and\nthat\\'s enough to differentiate it from a range operator.\nParentheses\\\nParentheses are quite natural in zsh if you\\'ve used extended regular\nexpressions. They are usually available, and only turned off if you set\nthe `SH_GLOB\\' option to ensure compatibility with shells that don\\'t\nhave it. The key part of the expression is the vertical bar, which\nspecifies an alternative. It can occur as many times as necessary;\n`(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m)\\' is a rather idiosyncratic way of\nwriting `[a-m]\\'. If you don\\'t include the vertical bar (we\\'ll see\nreasons for not doing so later), and you are generating filenames, you\nshould be careful that the expression doesn\\'t occur at the end of the\npattern, else it would be taken as a `glob qualifier\\', as described\nbelow. The rather unsightly hack of putting `(|)\\' (match the empty\nstring or the empty string --- guess what this matches?) right at the\nend will get around that problem.\nThe vertical bar usually needs to be inside parentheses so that the\nshell doesn\\'t take it as a pipe, but in some contexts where this won\\'t\nhappen, such as a case statement label, you can omit any parentheses\nthat would completely surround the pattern. So in\n  case $foo in\n    (bar|rod|pipe) print \"foo represents a piece of metal\"\n              ;;\n    (*) print \"Are you trying to be different?\"\n        ;;\n  esac\nthe surrounding parentheses are the required syntax for case, rather\nthan pattern parentheses --- the same syntax works in other shells.\nThen `bar|rod\\' is an ordinary zsh expression matching either bar\nor rod, in a context where the `|\\' can\\'t be mistaken for a pipe.\nIn fact, this whole example works with ksh --- but there the use of\n`|\\' is a special case, while in zsh it fits in with the standard\npattern rules.\nIndeed, ksh has slightly different ways of specifying patterns: to make\nthe use of parentheses less ambiguous, it requires a character before\nthe left parenthesis. The corresponding form for a simple alternative is\n`@(this|that)\\'. The `@\\' can also be a `?\\', for zero or one\noccurrences of what\\'s in the parentheses; `*\\' for any number of\nrepetitions, for example `thisthisthatthis\\'; or `!\\' for anything\nexcept what\\'s in the parentheses. Zsh allows this syntax if you set the\noption KSH_GLOB. Note that this is independent of the option\nSH_GLOB; if you set KSH_GLOB but not SH_GLOB, you can actually use\nboth forms for pattern matching, with the ksh form taking precedence in\nthe case of ambiguities. This is probably to be avoided. In ksh\nemulation, both options are set; this is the only sensible reason I know\nof for using these options at all. I\\'ll show some comparisons in the\nnext section.\nAn important thing to note is that when you are matching files, you\ncan\\'t put directory separators inside parentheses:\n  # Doesn't work!\n  print (foo/bar|bar/foo)/file.c\ndoesn\\'t work. The reason is that it\\'s simply too difficult to write;\npattern matching would be bound in a highly intricate way with searching\nthe directory hierarchy, with the end of a group sending you back up to\ntry another bit of the pattern on a directory you\\'d already visited.\nIt\\'s probably not impossible, but the pattern code maintainer (me)\nisn\\'t all that enthusiastic about it.\n[]{#l139}\n5.9.4: Extensions requiring EXTENDED_GLOB\nSetting EXTENDED_GLOB makes three new types of operator available:\nthose which excluded a particular pattern from matching; those which\nspecify that a pattern may occur a repeated number of times; and a set\nof `globbing flags\\', a little bit like parameter flags which I\\'ll\ndescribe in a later section since they are really the icing on the cake.\nNegative matches or exclusions\\\nThe simpler of the two exclusions uses `^\\' to introduce a pattern\nwhich must not be matched. So a trivial example (I will assume for\nmuch of the rest of the chapter that the option EXTENDED_GLOB is set)\nis:\n  [[ foo = ^foo ]]\n  [[ bar = ^foo ]]\nThe first test fails, the second succeeds. It\\'s important to realise\nthat that the pattern demands nothing else whatever about the relevant\npart of the test string other than it doesn\\'t match the pattern that\nfollows: it doesn\\'t say what length the matched string should have, for\nexample. So\n  [[ foo = *^foo ]]\nactually does match: * swallows up the whole string, and the\nremaining empty string successfully fails to be `foo\\'. Remember the\nmantra: each part of the pattern matches the longest possible substring\nthat causes the remainder of the pattern not to fail (unless, of course,\nfailure is unavoidable).\nNote that the ^ applies to the whole pattern to its right, either to\nthe end of the string, or to the end of the nearest enclosing\nparenthesis. Here\\'s a couple more examples:\n  [[ foo = ^foo* ]]\nOverall, this fails to match: the pattern `foo*\\' always matches the\nstring on the left, so negating means it always fails.\n  [[ foo = (^foo)* ]]\nThis is similar to the last example but one. The expression in the\nparenthesis first matches against foo; this causes the overall match\nto fail because of the ^, so it backs up one character and tries\nagain. Now `fo\\' is successfully matched by ^foo and the remaining\n`o\\' is matched by the *, so the overall match succeeds. When you\nknow about backreferences, you will be able to confirm that, indeed, the\nexpression in parentheses matches `fo\\'. This is a quite subtle\npoint: it\\'s easy to imagine that `^foo\\' says `match any three\nletter string except the one I\\'ve given you\\', but actually there is no\nrequirement that it match three letters, or indeed any.\nIn filename generation, the ^ has a lower precedence than a slash:\n  % print /*/tmp\n  /data/tmp /home/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp\n  % print /^usr/tmp\n  /data/tmp /home/tmp /var/tmp\nsuccessfully caused the first level of directories to match anything but\n`usr\\'. A typical use of this with files is `^*.o\\' to match\neverything in a directory except files which end with `.o\\'.\nNote one point mentioned in the FAQ --- probably indicating the reason\nthat `^\\' is only available with EXTENDED_GLOB switched on. Some\ncommands use an initial `^\\' to indicate a control character; in\nfact, zsh\\'s bindkey builtin does this:\n  bindkey '^z' backward-delete-word\nwhich attaches the given function to the keystroke Ctrl-z. You must\nremember to quote that keystroke expression, otherwise it would expand\nto a list of all files in the current directory not called `z\\', very\nlikely all of them.\nThere\\'s another reason this isn\\'t available by default: in some\nversions of the Bourne shell, `^\\' was used for pipes since `|\\'\nwas missing on some keyboards.\nThe other exclusion operator is closely related. `pat1~pat2\\'\nmeans `anything that matches pat1 as long as it doesn\\'t also match\npat2\\'. If pat1 is *, you have the same effect as `^\\' --- in\nfact, that\\'s pretty much how `^\\' is currently implemented.\nThere\\'s one significant difference between `*~pat\\' and\n`^pat\\': the ~ has a lower precedence than `/\\' when\nmatching against filenames. What\\'s more, the pattern on the right of\nthe ~ is not treated as a filename at all; it\\'s simply matched\nagainst any filename found on the left, to see if it should be rejected.\nThis sounds like black magic, but it\\'s actually quite useful,\nparticularly in combination with the recursive globbing syntax:\n   print **/*~*/CVS(/)\nmatches any subdirectory of the current directory to any depth, except\nfor directories called CVS --- the `*\\' on the right of the\n`~\\' will match any character including `/\\'. The final `(/)\\'\nis a glob qualifier indicating that only directories are to be allowed\nto match --- note that it\\'s a positive assertion, despite being after\nthe `~\\'. Glob qualifiers do not feel the effect of preceding\nexclusion operators.\nNote that in that example, any subdirectory of a directory called CVS\nwould have matched successfully; you can see from the pattern that the\nexpression after the `~\\' wouldn\\'t weed it out. Slightly less\nobviously, the `**/*\\' matches files in the current directory, while\nthe `*/CVS\\' never matches a `CVS\\' in the current directory, so\nthat could appear. If you want to, you can fix that up like this:\n   print **/*~(*/|)CVS(/*|)(/)\nagain relying on the fact that `/\\'s are not special after the\n`~\\'. This will ruthlessly weed out any path with a directory\ncomponent called CVS. An easier, but less instructive, way is\n   print ./**/*~*/CVS(/)\nYou can restrict the range of the tilde operator by putting it in\nparentheses, so `/(*~usr)/tmp\\' is equivalent to `/^usr/tmp\\'.\nA `~\\' at the beginning is never treated as excluding what follows;\nas you already know, it has other uses. Also, a `~\\' at the end of a\npattern isn\\'t special either; this is lucky, because Emacs produces\nbackup files by adding a `~\\' to the end of the file name. You may\nhave problems if you use Emacs\\'s facility for numbered backup files,\nhowever, since then there is a `~\\' in the middle of the file name,\nwhich will need to be quoted when used in the shell.\nClosures or repeated matches\\\nThe extended globbing symbols `#\\' and `##\\', when they occur in a\npattern, are equivalent to `*\\' and `+\\' in extended regular\nexpressions: `#\\' allows the previous pattern to match any number of\ntimes, including zero, while with `##\\' it must match at least once.\nNote that this pattern does not extend beyond two hashes --- there is\nno special symbol `###\\', which is not recognised as a pattern at\nall.\nThe `previous pattern\\' is the smallest possible item which could be\nconsidered a complete pattern. Very often it is something in\nparentheses, but it could be a group in square or angle brackets, or a\nsingle ordinary character. Note particularly that in\n  # fails\n  [[ foofoo = foo# ]]\nthe test fails, because the `#\\' only refers to the final `o\\',\nnot the entire string. What you need is\n  # succeeds\n  [[ foofoo = (foo)# ]]\nIt might worry you that `#\\' also introduces comments. Since a\nwell-formatted pattern never has `#\\' at the start, however, this\nisn\\'t a problem unless you expect comments to start in the middle of a\nword. It turns out that doesn\\'t even happen in other shells ---\n`#\\' must be at the start of a line, or be unquoted and have space in\nfront of it, to be recognised as introducing a comment. So in fact there\nis no clash at all here. There is, of course, a clash if you expect\n`.#foo.c.1.131\\' (probably a file produced by the version control\nsystem CVS while attempting to resolve a conflict) to be a plain string,\nhence the dependence on the EXTENDED_GLOB option.\nThat\\'s probably all you need to know; the `#\\' operators are\ngenerally much easier to understand than the exclusion operators. Just\nin case you are confused, I might as well point out that repeating a\npattern is not the same as repeating a string, so\n  [[ onetwothreetwoone = (one|two|three)## ]]\nsuccessfully matches; the string is different for each repetition of the\npattern, but that doesn\\'t matter.\nWe now have enough information to construct a list of correspondences\nbetween zsh\\'s normal pattern operators and the ksh ones, available with\nKSH_GLOB. Be careful with `!(...)\\'; it seems to have a slightly\ndifferent behaviour to the zsh near-equivalent. The following table is\nlifted directly from the zsh FAQ.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n      ksh              zsh         Meaning\n     ------           ------       ---------\n     !(foo)            ^foo        Anything but foo.\n                or   foo1~foo2     Anything matching foo1 but foo2.\n@(foo1|foo2|...)  (foo1|foo2|...)  One of foo1 or foo2 or ...\n     ?(foo)           (foo|)       Zero or one occurrences of foo.\n     *(foo)           (foo)#       Zero or more occurrences of foo.\n     +(foo)           (foo)##      One or more occurrences of foo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn both languages, the vertical bar for alternatives can appear inside\nany set of parentheses. Beware of the precedences of ^foo and\n`foo1~foo2\\'; surround them with parentheses, too, if necessary.\n[]{#l140}\n5.9.5: Recursive globbing\nOne of the most used special features of zsh, and one I\\'ve already used\na couple of times in this section, is recursive globbing, the ability to\nmatch any directory in an arbitrarily deep (or, as we say in English,\ntall) tree of directories. There are two forms: `**/\\' matches a set\nof directories to any depth, including the top directory, what you get\nby replacing `**/\\' by `./, i.e. **/foo can match foo in the\ncurrent directory, but also bar/foo, bar/bar/bar/foo,\nbar/bar/bar/poor/little/lambs/foo nad so on. `***/\\' does the same,\nbut follows symbolic links; this can land you in infinite loops if the\nlink points higher up in the same directory hierarchy --- an odd thing\nto do, but it can happen.\nThe `**/\\' or `***/\\' can\\'t appear in parentheses; there\\'s no\nway of specifying them as alternatives. As already noticed, however, the\nprecedence of the exclusion operator `~\\' provides a useful way of\nremoving matches you don\\'t want. Remember, too, the recursion operators\ndon\\'t need to be at the start of the pattern:\n  print ~/**/*.txt\nprints the name of all the files under your home directory ending with\n`.txt\\'. Don\\'t expect it to be particularly fast; it\\'s not as well\noptimised as the standard UNIX command find, although it is a whole\nlot more convenient. The traditional way of searching a file which may\nbe anywhere in a directory tree is along the lines of:\n  find ~/src -name '*.c' -print | xargs grep pattern\nwhich is horrendously cumbersome. What\\'s happening is that find\noutputs a newline-separated list of all the files it finds, and xargs\nassembles these as additional arguments to the command\n`grep pattern\\'. It simplifies in zsh to the much more natural\n  grep pattern ~/src/**/*.c\nIn fact, strictly speaking you probably ought to use\n  find ~/src -name '*.c' -print0 | xargs -0 grep pattern\nfor the other form --- this passes null-terminated strings around,\nwhich is safer since any character other than a NUL or a slash can occur\nin a filename. But of course you don\\'t need that now.\nDo remember that this includes the current directory in the search, so\nin that last example `foo.c\\' in the directory where you typed the\ncommand would be searched. This isn\\'t completely obvious because of the\n`/\\' in the pattern, which erroneously seems to suggest at least one\ndirectory.\nIt\\'s a little known fact that this is a special case of a more general\nsyntax, `(pat/)#\\'. This syntax isn\\'t perfect, either; it\\'s the\nonly time where a `/\\' can usefully occur in parentheses. The pattern\npat is matched against each directory; if it succeeds, pat is\nmatched against each of the subdirectories, and so on, again to\narbitrary depth. As this uses the character `#\\', it requires the\nEXTENDED_GLOB option, which the more common syntax doesn\\'t, since\nno-one would write two *\\'s in a row for any other reason.\nYou should consider the `/)\\' to be in effect a single pattern token;\nfor example in\n  % print (F*|B*/)#*.txt\n  FOO/BAR/thingy.txt\nboth `F*\\' and `B*\\' are possible directory names, not just the\n`B*\\' next to the slash. The difference between `#\\' and `##\\'\nis respected here --- with the former, zero occurrences of the pattern\nmay be matched (i.e. `*.txt\\'), while with the latter, at least one\nlevel of subdirectories is required. Thus `(*/)##*.txt\\' is\nequivalent to `*/**/*.txt\\', except that the first `*\\' in the\nsecond pattern will match a symbolic link to a directory; there\\'s no\nway of forcing the other syntax to follow symbolic links.\nFairly obviously, this syntax is only useful with files. Other uses of\npatterns treat slashes as ordinary characters and `**\\' or `***\\'\nthe same as a single `*\\'. It\\'s not an error to use multiple\n`*\\'s, though, just pointless.\n[]{#l141}\n5.9.6: Glob qualifiers\nAnother very widely used zsh enhancement is the ability to select types\nof file by using `glob qualifiers\\', a group of (rather terse) flags in\nparentheses at the end of the pattern. Like recursive globbing, this\nfeature only applies for filename generation in the command line\n(including an array assignment), not for other uses of patterns.\nThis feature requires the BARE_GLOB_QUAL option to be turned on, which\nit usually is; the name implies that one day there may be another,\nperhaps more ksh-like, way of doing the same thing with a more\nindicative syntax than just a pair of parentheses.\nFile types\\\nThe simplest glob qualifiers are similar to what the completion system\nappends at the end of file names when the LIST_TYPES option is on;\nthese are in turn similar to the indications used by `ls -F\\'. So\n  % print *(.)\n  file1 file2 cmd1 cmd2\n  % print *(/)\n  dir1 dir2\n  % print *(*)\n  cmd1 cmd2\n  % print *(@)\n  symlink1 symlink2\nwhere I\\'ve invented unlikely filenames with obvious types. file1 and\nfile2 were supposed to be just any old file; (.) picks up those but\nalso executable files. Sockets (=), named pipes (p), and device\nfiles (%) including block (%b) and character (%c) special files\nare the other types of file you can detect.\nAssociated with type, you can also specify the number of hard links to a\nfile: (l2) specifies exactly 2 links, (l+3) more than 3 links,\n(l-5) fewer than 5.\nFile permissions\\\nActually, the (*) qualifier really applies to the file\\'s permissions,\nnot it\\'s type, although it does require the file to be an executable\nnon-special file, not a directory nor anything wackier. More basic\nqualifiers which apply just to the permissions of the files are (r),\n(w) and (x) for files readable, writeable and executable by the\nowner; (R), (W) and (X) correspond to those for world permissions,\nwhile (A), (I) and (E) do the job for group permissions ---\nsorry, the Latin alphabet doesn\\'t have middle case. You can speciy\npermissions more exactly with `(f)\\' for file permissions: the\nexpression after this can take various forms, but the easiest is\nprobably a delimited string, where the delimiters work just like the\narguments for parameter flags and the arguments, separated by commas,\nwork just like symbolic arguments to chmod; the example from the\nmanual,\n  print *(f:gu+w,o-rx:)\npicks out files (of any type) which are writeable by the owner\n(`user\\') and group, and neither readable nor executable by anyone else\n(`other\\').\nFile ownership\\\nYou can match on the other three mode bits, setuid ((s)), setgid ((S))\nand sticky ((t)), but I\\'m not going to go into what those are if you\ndon\\'t know; your system\\'s manual page for chmod may (or may not)\nexplain.\nNext, you can pick out files by owner; (U) and (G) say that you or\nyour group, respectively, owns the file --- really the effective user\nor group ID, which is usually who you are logged in as, but this may be\naltered by tricks such as a programme running setuid or setgid (the\nthings I\\'m not going to explain). More generally, u0 says that the\nfile is owned by root and (u501) says it is owned by user ID 501; you\ncan use names if you delimiit them, so (u:pws:) says that the owner\nmust be user pws; similarly for groups with (g).\nFile times\\\nYou can also pick files by modification ((m)) or access ((a)) time,\neither before ((-)), at, or after ((+)) a specific time, which may be\nmeasured in days (the default), months ((M)), weeks ((w)), hours ((h)),\nminutes ((m)) or seconds ((s)). These must appear in the order m or\na, optional unit, optional plus or minus, number. Hence:\n  print *(m1)\nFiles that were modified one day ago --- i.e. less than 48 but more\nthan 24 hours ago.\n  print *(aw-1)\nFiles accessed within the last week, i.e. less than 7 days ago.\nIn addition to (m) and ((a)), there is also (c), which is sometimes\nsaid to refer to file creation, but it is actually something a bit less\nuseful, namely inode change. The inode is the structure on disk where\nUNIX-like filing systems record the information about the location and\nnature of the file. Information here can change when some aspect of the\nfile information, such as permissions, changes.\nFile size\\\nThe qualifier (L) refers to the file size (`L\\' is actually for\nlength), by default in bytes, but it can be in kilobytes (k),\nmegabytes (m), or 512-byte blocks (p, unfortunately). Plus and minus\ncan be used in the same way as for times, so\n  print *(Lk3)\ngives files 3k large, i.e. larger than 2k but smaller than 4k, while\n  print *(Lm+1)\ngives files larger than a megabyte.\nNote that file size applies to directories, too, although it\\'s not very\nuseful. The size of directories is related to the number of slots for\nfiles currently available inside the directory (at the highest level,\ni.e. not counting children of children and deeper). This changes\nautomatically if necessary to make more space available.\nFile matching properties\\\nThere are a few qualifiers which affect option settings just for the\nmatch in question: (N) turns on NULL_GLOB, so that the pattern\nsimply disappears from the command line if it fails to match; (D)\nturns on GLOB_DOTS, to match even files beginning with a `.\\', as\ndescribed above; (M) or (T) turn on MARK_DIRS or LIST_TYPES, so\nthat the result has an extra character showing the type of a directory\nonly (in the first case) or of any special file (in the second); and\n(n) turns on NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT, so that numbers in the filename are\nsorted arithmetically --- so 10 comes after 1A, because the 1 and\n10 are compared before the next character is looked at.\nOther than being local to the pattern qualified, there is no difference\nin effect from setting the option itself.\nCombining qualifiers\\\nOne of the reasons that some qualifiers have slightly obscure syntax is\nthat you can chain any number of them together, which requires that the\nfile has all of the given properties. In other words `*(UWLk-10)\\'\nare files owned by you, world writeable and less than 10k in size.\nYou can negate a set of qualifiers by putting `^\\' in front of those,\nso `*(ULk-10^W)\\' would specify the corresponding files which were\nnot world writeable. The `^\\' applies until the end of the flags, but\nyou can put in another one to toggle back to assertion instead of\nnegation.\nAlso, you can specify alternatives; `*(ULk-10,W)\\' are files which\neither are owned by you and are less than 10k, or are world writeable\n--- note that the `and\\' has higher precedence than the `or\\'.\nYou can also toggle whether the assertions or negations made by\nqualifiers apply to symbolic links, or the files found by following\nsymbolic links. The default is the former --- otherwise the (@)\nqualifier wouldn\\'t work on its own. By preceding qualifiers with -,\nthey will follow symbolic links. So *(-/) matches all directories,\nincluding those reached by a symbolic link (or more than one symbolic\nlink, up to the limit allowed by your system). As with `^\\', you can\ntoggle this off again with another one `-\\'. To repeat what I said in\nchapter 3, you can\\'t distinguish between the\nother sort of links, hard links, and a real file entry, because a hard\nlink just supplies an alternative but equivalent name for a file.\nThere\\'s a nice trick to find broken symlinks: the pattern\n`**/*(-@)\\'. This is supposed to follow symlinks; but that `@\\'\ntells it to match only on symlinks! There is only one case where this\ncan succeed, namely where the symlink is broken. (This was pointed out\nto me by Oliver Kiddle.)\nSorting and indexing qualifiers\\\nNormally the result of filename generation is sorted by alphabetic order\nof filename. The globbing flags (o) and (O) allow you to sort in\nnormal or reverse order of other things: n is for names, so (on)\ngives the default behaviour while (On) is reverse order; L, l,\nm, a and c refer to the same thing as the normal flags with those\nletters, i.e. file size, number of links, and modification, access and\ninode change times. Finally, d refers to subdirectory depth; this is\nuseful with recursive globbing to show a file tree ordered depth-first\n(subdirectory contents appear before files in any given directory) or\ndepth-last.\nNote that time ordering produces the most recent first as the standard\nordering ((om), etc.), and oldest first as the reverse ordering\n(OM), etc.). With size, smallest first is the normal ordering.\nYou can combine ordering criteria, with the most important coming first;\neach criterion must be preceded by o or O to distinguish it from an\nordinary globbing flag. Obviously, n serves as a complete\ndiscriminator, since no two different files can have the same name, so\nthis must appear on its own or last. But it\\'s a good idea, when doing\ndepth-first ordering, to use odon, so that files at a particular depth\nappear in alphabetical order of names. Try\n  print **/*(odon)\nto see the effect, preferably somewhere above a fairly shallow directory\ntree or it will take a long time.\nThere\\'s an extra trick you can play with ordered files, which is to\nextract a subset of them by indexing. This works just like arrays, with\nindividual elements and slices.\n  print *([1])\nThis selects a single file, the first in alphabetic order since we\nhaven\\'t changed the default ordering.\n  print *(om[1,5])\nThis selects the five most recently modified files (or all files, if\nthere are five or fewer). Negative indices are understood, too:\n  print *(om[1,-2])\nselects all files but the oldest, assuming there are at least two.\nFinally, a reminder that you can stick modifiers after qualifiers, or\nindeed in parentheses without any qualifiers:\n  print **/*(On:t)\nsorts files in subdirectories into reverse order of name, but then\nstrips off the directory part of that name. Modifiers are applied right\nat the end, after all file selection tasks.\nEvaluating code as a test\\\nThe most complicated effect is produced by the (e) qualifer. which is\nfollowed by a string delimited in the now-familiar way by either\nmatching brackets of any of the four sorts or a pair of any other\ncharacters. The string is evaluated as shell code; another layer of\nquotes is stripped off, to make it easier to quote the code from\nimmediate expansion. The expression is evaulated separately for each\nmatch found by the other parts of the pattern, with the parameter\n$REPLY set to the filename found.\nThere are two ways to use (e). First, you can simply rely on the\nreturn code. So:\n  print *(e:'[[ -d $REPLY ]]':)\n  print *(/)\nare equivalent. Note that quotes around the expression, which are\nnecessary in addition to the delimiters (here `:\\') for expressions\nwith special characters or whitespace. In particular, $REPLY would\nhave been evaluated too early --- before file generation took place\n--- if it hadn\\'t been quoted.\nSecondly, the function can alter the value of $REPLY to alter the name\nof the file. What\\'s more, the expression can set $reply (which\noverrides the use of $REPLY) to an array of files to be inserted into\nthe command line; it may be any size from zero items upward.\nHere\\'s the example in the manual:\n  print *(e:'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)\nNote the string is delimited by colons and quoted. This takes each\nfile in the current directory, and for each returns a match which has\ntwo entires, the filename with `1\\' appended and the filename with\n`2\\' appended.\nFor anything more complicated than this, you should write a shell\nfunction to use $REPLY and set that or $reply. Then you can replace\nthe whole expression in quotes with that name.\n[]{#l142}\n5.9.7: Globbing flags: alter the behaviour of matches\nAnother EXTENDED_GLOB features is `globbing flags\\'. These are a bit\nlike the flags that can appear in perl regular expressions; instead of\nmaking an assertion about the type of the resulting match, like glob\nqualifiers do, they affect the way the match is performed. Thus they are\navailable for all uses of pattern matching --- though some flags are\nnot particularly useful with filename generation.\nThe syntax is borrowed from perl, although it\\'s not the same: it looks\nlike `(#X)\\', where X is a letter, possibily followed by an\nargument (currently only a number and only if the letter is `a\\').\nPerl actually uses `?\\' instead of `#\\'; what these have in common\nis that they can\\'t appear as a valid pattern characters just after an\nopen parenthesis, since they apply to the pattern before. Zsh doesn\\'t\nhave the rather technical flags that perl does (lookahead assertions and\nso on); not surprisingly, its features are based around the shortcuts\noften required by shell users.\nMixed-case matches\\\nThe simplest sort of globbing flag will serve as an example. You can\nmake a pattern, or a portion of a pattern, match case-insensitively with\nthe flag (#i):\n  [[ FOO = foo ]]\n  [[ FOO = (#i)foo ]]\nAssuming you have EXTENDED_GLOB set so that the `#\\' is an active\npattern character, the first match fails while the second succeeds. I\nmentioned portions of a pattern. You can put the flags at any point in\nthe pattern, and they last to the end either of the pattern or any\nenclosing set of parentheses, so in\n  [[ FOO = f(#i)oo ]]\n  [[ FOO = F(#i)oo ]]\nonce more the first match fails and the second succeeds. Alternatively,\nyou can put them in parentheses to limit their scope:\n  [[ FOO = ((#i)fo)o ]]\n  [[ FOO = ((#i)fo)O ]]\ngives a failure then a success again. Note that you need extra\nparentheses; the ones around the flag just delimit that, and have no\ngrouping effect. This is different from Perl.\nThere are two flags which work in exactly the same way: (#l) says that\nonly lowercase letters in the pattern match case-insensitively;\nuppercase letters in the pattern only match uppercase letters in the\ntest string. This is a little like Emacs\\' behaviour when searching case\ninsensitvely with the case-fold-search option variable set; if you\ntype an uppercase character, it will look only for an uppercase\ncharacter. However, Emacs has the additional feature that from that\npoint on the whole string becomes case-sensitive; zsh doesn\\'t do that,\nthe flag applies strictly character by character.\nThe third flag is (#I), which turns case-insensitive matching off from\nthat point on. You won\\'t often need this, and you can get the same\neffect with grouping --- unless you are applying the case-insensitive\nflag to multiple directories, since groups can\\'t span more than one\ndirectory. So\n  print (#i)/a*/b*/(#I)c*\nis equivalent to\n  print /[aA]*/[bB]*/c*\nNote that case-insensitive searching only applies to characters not in a\nspecial pattern of some sort. In particular, ranges are not\nautomatically made case-insensitive; instead of `(#i)[ab]*\\', you\nmust use `[abAB]*\\'. This may be unexpected, but it\\'s consistent\nwith how other flags, notably approximation, work.\nYou should be careful with matching multiple directories\ncase-insensitively. First,\n  print (#i)~/.Z*\ndoesn\\'t work. This is due to the order of expansions: filename\nexpansion of the tilde happens before pattern matching is ever\nattempted, and the `~\\' isn\\'t at the start where filename expansion\nneeds to find it. It\\'s interpreted as an empty string which doesn\\'t\nmatch `/.Z*\\', case-insensitively --- in other words, it will match\nany empty string.\nHence you should put `(#i)\\' and any other globbing flags after the\nfirst slash --- unless, for some reason, you really want the\nexpression to match `/Home/PWS/\\' etc. as well as `/home/pws\\'.\nSecond,\n  print (#i)$HOME/.Z*\ndoes work --- prints all files beginning `.Z\\' or `.z\\' in your\nhome directory --- but is inefficient. Assume $HOME expands to my\nhome directory, /home/pws. Then you are telling the shell it can match\nin the directories `/Home/PWS/\\', `/HOME/pWs\\' and so on. There\\'s\nno quick way of doing this --- the shell has to look at every single\nentry first in `/\\' and then in `/home\\' (assuming that\\'s the\nonly match at that level) to check for matches. In summary, it\\'s a good\nidea to use the fact that the flag doesn\\'t have to be at the beginning,\nand write this as:\n  print ~/(#i).Z*\nOf course,\n  print ~/.[zZ]*\nwould be easier and more standard in this oversimplified example.\nOn Cygwin, a UNIX-like layer running on top of, uh, a well known\ngraphical user interface claiming to be an operating system, filenames\nare usually case insensitive anyway. Unfortunately, while Cygwin itself\nis wise to this fact, zsh isn\\'t, so it will do all that extra searching\nwhen you give it the (#i) flag with an otherwise explicit string.\nA piece of good news, however, is that matching of uppercase and\nlowercase characters will handle non-ASCII character sets, provided your\nsystem handles locales, (or to use the standard hieroglyphics, `i18n\\'\n--- count the letters between `i\\' and `n\\' in\n`internationalization\\', which may not even be a word anyway, and\nwince). In that case you or your system administrator or the shell\nenvironment supplied by your operating system vendor needs to set\n$LC_ALL or $LC_CTYPE to the appropriate locale -- C for the\ndefault, en for English, uk for Ukrainian (which I remember because\nit\\'s confusing in the United Kingdom), and so on.\n`Backreferences\\'\\\nThe feature labelled as `backreferences\\' in the manual isn\\'t really\nthat at all, which is my fault. Many regular expression matchers allow\nyou to refer back to bits already matched. For example, in Perl the\nregular expression `([A-Z]{3})$1\\' says `match three uppercase\ncharacters followed by the same three characters again. The `$1\\' is\na backreference.\nZsh has a similar feature, but in fact you can\\'t use it while matching\na single pattern; it just makes the characters matched by parentheses\navailable after a successful complete match. In this, it\\'s a bit more\nlike Emacs\\'s match-beginning and match-end functions.\nYou have to turn it on for each pattern with the globbing flag\n`(#b)\\'. The reason for this is that it makes matches involving\nparentheses a bit slower, and most of the time you use parentheses just\nfor ordinary filename generation where this feature isn\\'t useful. Like\nmost of the other globbing flags, it can have a local effect: only\nparentheses after the flag produce backreferences, and the effect is\nlocal to enclosing parentheses (which don\\'t feel the effect\nthemselves). You can also turn it off with `(#B)\\'.\nWhat happens when a pattern with active parentheses matches is that the\nelements of the array $match, $mbegin and $mend are set to reflect\neach active parenthesis in turn --- names inspired by the\ncorresponding Emacs feature. The string matching the first pair of\nparentheses is stored in the first element of $match, its start\nposition in the string is stored in the first element of $mbegin, and\nits end position in the string $mend. The same happens for later\nmatched parentheses. The parentheses around any globbing flags do not\ncount.\n$mbegin and $mend use the indexing convention currently in effect,\ni.e. zero offset if KSH_ARRAYS is set, unit offset otherwise. This\nmeans that if the string matched against is stored in the parameter\n$teststring, then it will always be true that ${match[1]} is the\nsame string as ${teststring[${mbegin[1]},${mend[1]}]}. and so on.\n(I\\'m assuming, as usual, that KSH_ARRAYS isn\\'t set.) Unfortunately,\nthis is different from the way the E parameter flag works --- that\nsubstitutes the character after the end of the matched substring. Sorry!\nIt\\'s my fault for not following that older convention; I thought the\nstring subscripting convention was more relevant.\nAn obvious use for this is to match directory and non-directory parts of\na filename:\n  local match mbegin mend\n  if [[ /a/file/name = (#b)(*)/([^/]##) ]]; then\n    print -l ${match[1]} ${match[2]}\n  fi\nprints `/a/file\\' and `name\\'. The second parenthesis matches a\nslash followed by any number of characters, but at least one, which are\nnot slashes, while the first matches anything --- remember slashes\naren\\'t special in a pattern match of this form. Note that if this\nappears in a function, it is a good idea to make the three parameters\nlocal. You don\\'t have to clear them, or even make them arrays. If the\nmatch fails, they won\\'t be touched.\nThere\\'s a slightly simpler way of getting information about the match:\nthe flag (#m) puts the matched string, the start index, and the index\nfor the whole match into the scalars $MATCH, $MBEGIN and $MEND.\nIt may not be all that obvious why this is useful. Surely the whole\npattern always matches the whole string? Actually, you\\'ve already seen\ncases where this isn\\'t true for parameter substitutions:\n  local MATCH MBEGIN MEND string\n  string=aLOha\n  : ${(S)string##(#m)([A-Z]##)}\nYou\\'ll find this sets $MATCH to LO, $MBEGIN to 2 and $MEND to\n\nIn the parameter expansion, the (S) is for matching substrings, so\nthat the `##\\' match isn\\'t anchored to the start of $string. The\npattern is (#m)([A-Z]##), which means: turn on full-match\nbackreferencing and match any number of capital letters, but at least\none. This matches LO. Then the match parameters let you see where in\nthe test parameter the match occurred.\n\nThere\\'s nothing to stop you using both these types of backreferences at\nonce, and you can specify multiple globbing flags in the short form\n`(#bm)\\'. This will work with any combination of flags, except that\nsome such as `(#bB)\\' are obviously silly.\nBecause ordinary globbing produces a list of files, rather than just\none, this feature isn\\'t very useful and is turned off. However, it is\npossible to use backreferences in global substitutions and substitutions\non arrays; here are both at once:\n  % array=(mananan then in gone June)\n  % print ${array//(#m)?n/${(C)MATCH[1]}n}\n  mAnAnAn thEn In gOne JUne\nThe substitution occurs separately on each element of the array, and at\neach match in each element $MATCH gets set to what was matched. We use\nthis to capitalize every character that is followed by a lowercase\n`n\\'. This will work with the (#b) form, too. The perl equivalent\nof this is:\n  % perl -pe 's/.n/\\u$&/g' (People sometimes say Perl has a difficult syntax to understand; I hope\nI\\'m convincing you how naive that view is when you have zsh.)\nNow I can convince you of one point I made about excluded matches above:\n  % [[ foo = (#b)(^foo)* ]]  && print $match\n  fo\nAs claimed, the process of making the longest possible match, then\nbacktracking from the end until the whole thing is successful, leads to\nthe `(^foo)\\' matching `fo\\'.\nApproximate matching\\\nTo my knowledge, zsh is the first command line interpreter to make use\nof approximate matching. This is very useful because it provides the\nshell with an easy way of correcting what you\\'ve typed. First, some\nbasics about what I mean by `approximate matching\\'.\nThere are four ways you can make a mistake in typing. You can leave out\na letter which should be there; you can insert a letter which\nshouldn\\'t; you can type one letter instead of another; and you can\ntranspose two letters. The last one involves two different characters,\nso some systems for making approximate matches count it as two different\nerrors; but it\\'s a particularly common one when typing, and quite\nuseful to be able to handle as a single error. I know people who even\nhave `mkae\\' aliased to `make\\'.\nYou can tell zsh how many errors you are willing to allow in a pattern\nmatch by using, for example (#a1), which says only a single error\nallowed. The rules for the flag are almost identical to those for\ncase-insensitive matching, in particular for scoping and the way\napproximate matching is handled for a filename expansion with more than\none directory. The number of errors is global; if the shell manages to\nmatch a directory in a path with an error, one fewer error is allowed\nfor the rest of the path. You can specify as many errors as you like;\nthe practical limit is that with too many allowed errors the pattern\nwill match far too many strings. The shell doesn\\'t have a particularly\nnifty way of handling approximate matching (unlike, for example, the\nprogram agrep), but you are unlikely to encounter problems if the\nnumber of matches stays in a useful range.\nThe fact that the error count applies to the whole of a filename path is\na bit of a headache, actually, because we have to make sure the shell\nmatches each directory with the minimum number of errors. With a single\npattern, the shell doesn\\'t care as long as it doesn\\'t use up all the\nerrors it has, while with multiple directories if it uses up the errors\nearly on, it may fail to match something it should match. But you don\\'t\nhave to worry about that; this explanation is just to elicit sympathy.\nSo the pattern (#a1)README will match README, READ.ME, READ_ME,\nLEADME, REDME, READEM, and so on. It will not match _README_,\nReadMe, READ or AAREADME. However, you can combine it with\ncase-insensitivity, for which the short form (#ia1)README is allowed,\nand then it will match ReadMe, Read.Me, read_me, and so on. You\ncan consider filenames with multiple directories as single strings for\nthis purpose --- with one exception, that `foo/bar\\' and\n`fo/obar\\' are two errors apart, not one. Because the errors are\ncounted separately in each directory, you can\\'t transpose the `/\\'\nwith another character. This restriction doesn\\'t apply in other forms\nof pattern matching where / is not a special character.\nAnother common feature with case-insensitive matching is that only the\nliteral parts of the string are handled. So if you have `[0-9]\\' in a\npattern, that character must match a decimal digit even if approximation\nis active. This is often useful to impose a particular form at key\npoints. The main difficulty, as with the `/\\' in a directory, is that\ntransposing with another character is not allowed, either. In other\nwords, `(#a1)ab[0-9]\\' will fail to match `a1b\\'; it will match\nwith two errors, by removing the `b\\' before the digit and inserting\nit after.\nAs an example of what you can do with this feature, here is a simple\nfunction to correct misspelled filenames.\n  emulate -LR zsh\n  setopt extendedglob\n\n  local file trylist\n  integer approx max_approx=6\n\n  file=$1\n\n  if [[ -e $file ]]; then\n    # no correction necessary\n    print $file\n    return\n  fi\n\n  for (( approx = 1; approx The function tries to match a file with the minimum possible number of\nerrors, but in any case no more than 6. As soon as it finds a match, it\nwill print it out and exit. It\\'s still possible there is more than one\nmatch with that many errors, however, and in this case the complete list\nis printed. The function doesn\\'t handle `~\\' in the filename.\nIt does illustrate the fact that you can specify the number of\napproximations as a parameter. This is purely a consequence of the fact\nthat filename generation happens right at the end of the expansion\nsequence, after the parameters have already been substituted away. The\nnumbers and the letter in the globbing flag aren\\'t special characters,\nunlike the parentheses and the `#\\'; if you wanted those to be\nspecial when substituted from a parameter, you would need to set the\nKSH_GLOB flag, possibly by using the `~\\' parameter flag.\nA more complicated version of that function is included with the shell\ndistribution in the file Completion/Base/Widget/_correct_filename.\nThis is designed to be used either on its own, or as part of the\ncompletion system.\nIndeed, the completion system described in the next chapter is where you\nare most likely to come across approximate matching, buried inside\napproximate completion and correction --- in the first case, you tell\nthe shell to complete what you have typed, trying to correct mistakes,\nand in the second case, you tell the shell that you have finished typing\nbut possibly made some mistakes which it should correct. If you already\nhave the new completion system loaded, you can use ^Xc to correct a\nword on the command line; this is context-sensitive, so more\nsophisticated than the function I showed.\nAnchors\\\nThe last two globbing flags are probably the least used. They are there\nreally for completeness. They are (#s), to match only at the start of\na string, and (#e), to match only at the end. Unlike the other flags\nthey are purely local, just making a statement about the point where\nthey occur in the pattern.\nThey correspond to the much more commonly used `^\\' and `$\\' in\nregular expressions. The difference is that shell patterns nearly always\nmatch a complete string, so telling the pattern that a certain point is\nthe start or end isn\\'t usually very useful. There are two occasions\nwhen it is. The first is when the start or end is to be matched as an\nalternative to something else. For example,\n  [[ $file = *((#s)|/)dirpart((#e)|/)* ]]\nsucceeds if dirpart is a complete path segment of $file --- with a\nslash or nothing at all before and after it. Remember, once again, that\nslashes aren\\'t special in pattern matches unless they\\'re performing\nfilename generation. The effect of these two flags isn\\'t altered at all\nby their being inside another set of parentheses.\nThe second time these are useful is in parameter matches where the\npattern is not guaranteed to match a complete string. If you use (#s)\nor (#e), it will force that point to be the start or end despite the\noperator in use. So ${param##pattern(#e)} will remove\npattern from $param only if it matches the entire string: the ##\nmust match at the head, while the (#e) must match at the end.\nYou can get the effect with ${param:#pattern}, and further\nmore this is rather faster. The :# operator has some global knowledge\nabout how to match; it knows that since pattern will match as far as\nit can along the test string, it only needs to try the match once.\nHowever, since `##\\' just needs to match at the head of the string,\nit will backtrack along the pattern, trying to match pattern(#e),\nentirely heedless of the fact that the pattern itself specifically\nwon\\'t match if it doesn\\'t extend to the end. So it\\'s more efficient\nto use the special parameter operators whenever they\\'re available.\n[]{#l143}\n5.9.8: The function zmv\nThe shell is supplied with a function zmv, which may have been\ninstalled into the default $fpath, or can be found in the source tree\nin the directory Functions/Misc. This provides a way of renaming,\ncopying and linking files based on patterns. The idea is that you give\ntwo arguments, a pattern to match, and a string which uses that pattern.\nThe pattern to match has backreferences turned on; these are stored in\nthe positional parameters to make them easy to refer to. The function\ntries to be safe: any file whose name is not changed is simply ignored,\nand usually overwriting an existing file is an error, too. However, it\ndoesn\\'t make sure that there is a one to one mapping from source to\ntarget files; it doesn\\'t know if the target file is supposed to be a\ndirectory (though it could be smarter about that).\nIn the examples, I will use the option -n, which forces zmv to print\nout what it will do without actually doing it. This is a good thing to\ntry first if you are unsure.\nHere\\'s a simple example.\n  % ls\n  foo\n  % zmv -n '(*)' '${(U)1}'\n  mv -- foo FOO\nThe pattern matches anything in the current directory, excluding files\nbeginning with a `.\\' (the function starts with an `emulate\\', so\nGLOB_DOTS is forced to be off). The complete string is stored as the\nfirst backreference, which is in turn put into $1. Then the second\nargument is used and $1 in uppercase is substituted.\nEssentials of the function\\\nThe basic code in zmv is very simple. It boils down to more or less\nthe following.\n  setopt nobareglobqual extendedglob\n  local files pattern result f1 f2 match mbegin mend\n\n  pattern=$1\n  result=$2\n\n  for f1 in ${~pattern}; do\n    [[ $f1 = (#b)${~pattern} ]] || continue\n    set -- $match\n    f2=${(e)result}\n    mv -- $f1 $f2\n  done\nHere\\'s what\\'s going on. We store the arguments as $pattern and\n$result. We then expand the pattern to a list of files --- remember\nthat ${~pattern} makes the characters in $pattern active for the\npurposes of globbing. For each file we find, we match against the\npattern again, but this time with backreferences turned on, so that\nparentheses are expanded into the array $match. If, for some reason,\nthe pattern match failed this time, we just skip the file. Then we store\n$match in the positional parameters; the `-``-\\' for set and for\nmv is in case $match[1] begins with a `-\\'.\nThen we evaluate the result, assuming that it will refer to the\npositional parameters. In our example, $result contains argument\n`${(U)1}\\' and if we matched `foo\\', then $1 contains foo. The\neffect of `${(e)result}\\' is to perform an extra substitution on the\n${(U)1}, so $f2 will be set to FOO. Finally, we use the mv\ncommand to do the actual renaming. The effect of the -n option isn\\'t\nshown, but it\\'s essentially to put a `print\\' in front of the mv\ncommand line.\nNotice I set nobareglobqual, turning off the use of glob qualifiers.\nThat\\'s necessary because of all those parentheses; otherwise, `(*)\\'\nwould have been interpreted as a qualifier. There is an option, -Q,\nwhich will turn qualifiers back on, if you need them. That\\'s still not\nquite ideal, since the second pattern match, the one where we actually\nuse the backreferences, isn\\'t filename generation, just a test against\na string, so doesn\\'t handle glob qualifers. So in that case the code\nneeds to strip qualifiers off. It does this by a fairly simple pattern\nmatch which will work in simple cases, though you can confuse it if you\ntry hard enough, particularly if you have extra parentheses in the glob\nqualifier.\nNote also the use of `${(e)result}\\' to force substitution of\nparameters when $result is evaluated. This way of doing it safely\nignores other metacharacters which may be around: all $-expansions,\nplus backquote expansion, are performed, but otherwise $result is left\nalone.\nMore complicated examples\\\nzmv has some special handling for recursive globbing, but only with\nthe patterns **/ and ***/. If you put either of these in parentheses\nin the pattern, they will be spotted and used in the normal way. Hence,\n  % ls test\n  lonely\n  % zmv -n '(**/)lonely' '$1solitary'\n  mv -- test/lonely test/solitary\nNote that, as with other uses of `**/\\', the slash is part of the\nrecursive match, so you don\\'t need another one. You don\\'t need to\nseparate $1 from solitary either, since positional parameters are a\nspecial case, but you could use `${1}solitary\\' for the look of it.\nLike glob qualifiers, recursive matches are handled by some magic in the\nfunction; in ordinary globbing you can\\'t put these two forms inside\nparentheses.\nFor the lazy, the option -w (which means `with wildcards\\') will tell\nzmv to decide for itself where all the patterns are and automatically\nadd parentheses. The two examples so far become\n  zmv -nw '*' '${(U)1}'\n  zmv -nw '***/lonely' '$1solitary'\nwith exactly the same effects.\nAnother way of getting useful effects is to use the `${1//foo/bar}\\'\nsubstitution in the second argument. This gives you a general way of\nsubstitution bits in filenames. Often, you can then get away with having\n`(*)\\' as the first argument:\n  zmv '(*)' '${1//(#m)[aeiou]/${(U)MATCH}}'\ncapitalises all the vowels in all filenames in the current directory.\nYou may be familiar with a perl script called rename which does tricks\nlike this (though there\\'s another, less powerful, programme of the same\nname which simply replaces strings).\nThe effect of zmv\\\nIn addition to renaming, zmv can be made to copy or link files. If you\ncall it zcp or zln instead of zmv, it will have those effects, and\nin the case of zln you can use the option -s to create symbolic\nlinks, just as with ln. Beware the slightly confusing behaviour of\nsymbolic links containing relative directories, however.\nAlternatively, you can force the behavour of zmv, zcp and zln just\nby giving the options -M, -C or -L to the function, whatever it is\ncalled. Or you can use `-p prog\\' to execute prog instead of\nmv, cp or ln; prog should be able to be run as `prog -``-\noldname newname\\', whatever it does.\nThe option -i works a bit like the same option to the basic programmes\nwhich zmv usually calls, prompting you before any action --- in this\ncase, not just overwriting, but any action at all. Likewise, -f tells\nzmv to force overwriting of files, which it will usually refuse to do\nbecause of the potential dangers. Although many versions of mv etc.\ntake this option, some don\\'t, so it\\'s not passed down; instead\nthere\\'s a generic way of passing down options to the programmes\nexecuted, using -o followed by a string. For example,\n  % ls\n  foo\n  % zmv -np frud -o'-a -b' '(*)' '${(U)1}'\n  frud -a -b -- foo FOO\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide06.html":{"url":"zshguide06.html","title":"章节 6","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n[]{#comp}[]{#l144}\nChapter 6: Completion, old and new\nCompletion of command arguments is something zsh is particularly good\nat. The simplest case is that you hit , and the shell guesses\nwhat has to go there and fills it in for you:\n  % ls\n  myfile  theirfile  yourfile\n  % cat t\nexpands the command line to\n  % cat theirfile\nand you only had to type the initial letter, then TAB.\nIn the early days when this feature appeared in the C shell, only\nfilenames could be completed; there were no clever tricks to help you if\nthe name was ambiguous, it simply printed the unambiguous part and\nbeeped so that you had to decide what to do next. You could also list\npossible completions; for some reason this became attached to the ^D\nkey in csh, which in later shells with Emacs-like bindings also deletes\nthe next character, so that history has endowed zsh, like other shells,\nwith the slightly odd combined behaviour:\n  % cat yx \nNow move the cursor back one character onto the x and hit \\^D twice and\nyou see: yourfile. That doesn\\'t work if you use vi-like bindings, or,\nobviously, if you\\'ve rebound ^D.\nNext, it became possible to complete other items such as names of users,\ncommands or hosts. Then zsh weighed in with menu completion, so you\ncould keep on blindly hitting  until the right answer appeared,\nand never had to type an extra character yourself.\nThe next development was tcsh\\'s, and then zsh\\'s, programmable\ncompletion system; you could give instructions to the shell that in\ncertain contexts, only certain items should be completed; for example,\nafter cd, you would only want directories. In tcsh, there was a\ncommand called complete; each `complete ...\\' statement defined the\ncompletion for the arguments of a particular command, such as cd; the\nequivalent in zsh is compctl, which was inspired by complete but is\ndifferent in virtually every significant detail. There is a perl script\nlete2ctl in the Misc directory of the shell distribution to help you\nconvert from the tcsh to the zsh formats. You put a whole series of\ncompctl commands into .zshrc, and everything else is done by the\nshell.\nZsh\\'s system has become more and more sophisticated, and in version\n3.1.6 a new completion system appeared which is supposed to do\neverything for you: you simply call a function, compinit, from an\ninitialization file, after which zsh knows, for example, that gunzip\nshould be followed by files ending in .gz. The new system is based on\nshell functions, an added bonus since they are extremely flexible and\nyou already know the syntax. However, given the complexity it\\'s quite\ndifficult to get started writing your own completions now, and hard\nenough to know what to do to change the settings the way you like. The\nrest of the chapter should help.\nI shall concentrate on the new completion system, which seems destined\nto take over completely from the old one eventually, now that the 3.1\nrelease series has become the 4.0 production release. The old\ncompctl command is still available, and old completion definitions\nwill remain working in future versions of zsh --- in fact, on most\noperating systems which support dynamically linked libraries the old\ncompletion system is in a different file, which the shell loads when\nnecessary, so there\\'s very little overhead for this.\nThe big difference in the new system is that, instead of everything\nbeing set up once and for all when the shell starts, various bits of\nshell code are called after you hit , to generate the completions\nthere and then. There\\'s enough new in the shell that all those\nunmemorable options to compctl (`-f\\' for files `-v\\' for\nvariables and so on) can be replaced by commands that produce the list\nof completions directly; the key command in this case is called\n`compadd\\', which is passed this list and decides what to use to\ncomplete the word on the command line. So the simplest possible form of\nnew completion looks roughly like this:\n  # tell the shell that the function mycompletion can do completion\n  # when called by the widget name my-completion-widget, and that\n  # it behaves like the existing widget complete-word\n  zle -C my-completion-widget .complete-word mycompletion\n\n  # define a key that calls the completion widget\n  bindkey '^x^i' my-completion-widget\n\n  # define the function that will be called\n  mycompletion() {\n    # add a list of completions\n    compadd alpha bravo charlie delta\n  }\nThat\\'s very roughly what the completion system is doing, except that\nthe function is called _main_complete and calls a lot of other\nfunctions to do its dirty work based on the context where completion was\ncalled (all the things that compctl used to do), and the widgets are\njust the old completion widgets (`expand-or-complete\\' etc.)\nredefined and still bound to all the original keys. But, in case you\nhadn\\'t guessed, there\\'s more to it than that.\nHere\\'s a plan for the sections of this chapter.\n\nA broad description of completion and expansion, applying equally to\nold and new completion.\nHow to configure completion using shell options. Most of this\nsection applies to old completion, too, although I won\\'t explicitly\nflag up any differences. After this, I shall leave the compctl\nworld behind.\nHow to start up new completion.\nThe basics of how the new completion system works.\nHow to configure it using the new `zstyle\\' builtin.\nSeparate commands which do something other than the usual completion\nsystem, as well as some other editing widgets that have to do with\ncompletion.\nMatching control, a powerful way of deciding such things as whether\nto complete case-insensitively, to allow insertion of extra parts of\nwords before punctuation characters, or to ignore certain characters\nin the word on the command line.\nHow to write your own completion functions; you won\\'t need to have\ntoo solid an understanding of all the foregoing just to do simple\ncompletions, but I will gradually introduce the full baroque\nsplendour of how to make tags and styles work in your own functions,\nand how to make completion do the work of handling command arguments\nand options.\nEnds the chapter gracefully, on the old `beginning, middle, end\\'\nprinciple.\n\n[]{#l145}\n6.1: Completion and expansion\nMore things than just completion happen when you hit tab. The first\nthing that zsh tries to do is expand the line. Expansion was covered in\na previous chapter: basically all the things described there are\npossible candidates for expanding in-line by the editor. In other words,\nhistory substitutions with bangs, the various expansions using `$\\'\nor backquote, and filename generation (globbing) can all take place,\nwith the result replacing what was there on the command line:\n  % echo $PWD\n    ->    echo /home/pws/zsh/projects/zshguide\n  % echo `print $ZSH_VERSION`\n    ->    echo 3.1.7\n  % echo !!\n    ->    echo echo 3.1.7\n  % echo ~/.z*\n    ->    echo /home/pws/.zcompdump /home/pws/.zlogout\n          /home/pws/.zshenv /home/pws/.zshrc                   \nNote that the `~\\' also gets expanded in this case.\nThis is often a good time to remember the `undo\\' key, `^_\\' or\n`^Xu\\'; typing this will restore what was there before the expansion\nif you don\\'t like the result. Many keyboards have a quirk that what\\'s\ndescribed as `^_\\' should be typed as control with slash, which\nyou\\'d write `^/\\' except unfortunately that does something else;\nthis is not zsh\\'s fault. There\\'s another half-exception, namely\nfilename generation: paths like `~/file\\' don\\'t get expanded,\nbecause you usually know what they refer to and it\\'s usually convenient\nto leave them for use in completion. However, the `=cmdname\\' form\ndoes get expanded, unless you have NO_EQUALS set.\nIn fact, deciding whether expansion or completion takes place can\nsometimes be tricky, since things that would be expanded if they were\ncomplete, may need to be completed first; for example $PAT should\nprobably be completed to $PATH, but it\\'s quite possible there is a\nparameter $PAT too. You can decide which, if you prefer. First, the\ncommands expand-word, bound to `^X*\\', and the corresponding\ncommand for listing what would be expanded, list-expand, bound to\n`^Xg\\', do expansion only --- all possible forms except alias\nexpansion, including turning `~/file\\' into a full path.\nFrom the other point of view, you can use commands other than\nexpand-or-complete, the one bound by default to , to perform\nonly completion. The basic command for this is complete-word, which is\nnot bound by default. It is quite sensible to bind this to `^I\\'\n(i.e. ) if you are happy to use the separate commands for\nexpansion, i.e.\n  # Now tab does only completion, not expansion\n  bindkey '^i' complete-word\nFurthermore, if you do this and use the new completion system, then as\nwe shall see there is a way of making the completion system perform\nexpansion --- see the description of the _expand completer below. In\nthis case you have much more control over what forms of expansion are\ntried, and at what point, but you have to make sure you use\ncomplete-word, not expand-or-complete, else the standard expansion\nsystem will take over.\nThere\\'s a close relative of expand-or-complete,\nexpand-or-complete-prefix, not bound by default. The only difference\nis that it will ignore everything under and to the right of the cursor\nwhen completing. It\\'s as if there was a space where the cursor was,\nwith everything to be ignored shifted to the right (guess how it\\'s\nimplemented). Use this if you habitually type new words in the line\nbefore other words, and expect them to complete or expand on their own\neven before you\\'ve typed the space after them. Some other shells work\nthis way all the time. To be more explicit:\n  % ls\n  filename1\n  % ls filex\nMove the cursor to the x and hit tab. With expand-or-complete\nnothing happens; it\\'s trying to complete a file called `filex\\'\n--- or, with the option COMPLETE_IN_WORD set, it\\'s trying to find a\nfile whose name starts with `file\\' and ends with `x\\'. If you do\n  bindkey '^i' expand-or-complete-prefix\nand try the same experiment, you will find the whole thing is completed\nto `filename1x\\', so that the `x\\' was ignored, but not removed.\nOne possible trap is that the listing commands, both\ndelete-char-or-list, bound by default to `^D\\' in emacs mode, and\nlist-options, bound by default to `^D\\' in vi insert mode and the\nbasic command for listing completions as it doesn\\'t have the\ndelete-character behaviour, do not show possible expansions, so with the\ndefault bindings you can use `^D\\' to list, then hit  and find\nthat the line has been completely rewritten by some expansion. Using\ncomplete-word instead of expand-or-complete will of course fix this.\nIf you know how to write new editor widgets (chapter\n4), you can make up a function which tries\nlist-expand, and if that fails tries list-options.\nThere are four completion commands I haven\\'t mentioned yet: three are\nmenu-complete, menu-expand-or-complete and reverse-menu-complete,\nwhich perform menu completion, where you can cycle through all possible\ncompletions by hitting the same key. The first two correspond to\ncomplete-word and expand-or-complete respectively, while the third\nhas no real equivalent as it takes you backwards through a completion\nlist. The effect of the third can\\'t be reached just by setting options\nfor menu completion, so it\\'s a useful one to bind separately. I have it\nbound to `\\M-\\C-i\\', i.e. tab with the Meta key pressed down, but\nit\\'s not bound by default.\nThe fourth is menu-select, which performs an enhanced form of menu\ncompletion called `menu selection\\' which I\\'ll describe below when I\ntalk about options. You have to make sure the zsh/complist module is\nloaded to use this zle command. If you use the style, zsh should be able\nto load this automatically when needed, as long as you have dynamic\nloading, which you probably do these days. []{#l146}\n6.2: Configuring completion using shell options\nThere are two main ways of altering the behaviour of completion without\nwriting or rewriting shell functions: shell options, as introduced in\nchapter 2, and styles, as introduced above. I\nshall first discuss the shell options, although as you will see some of\nthese refer to the styles mechanism. Setting shell options affects every\nsingle completion, unless special care has been taken (using a\ncorresponding style for the context, or setting an option locally) to\navoid that.\nIn addition to the options which directly affect the completion system,\ncompletion is sensitive to various other options which describe shell\nbehaviour. For example, if the option MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST is set, so\nthat arguments of all commands looking like `foo=~/file\\' have the\n`~\\' expanded as if it was at the start of an argument, then the\ndefault completion for arguments of commands not specially handled will\ntry to complete filenames after the `=\\'.\nNeedless to say, if you write completion functions you will need to\nworry about a lot of other options which can affect shell syntax. The\nmain starting point for completion chosen by context (everything except\nthe commands for particular completions bound separately to keystrokes)\nis the function _main_complete, which includes the effect of the\nfollowing lines to make sure that at least the basic options are set up\nwithin completion functions:\n  setopt glob bareglobqual nullglob rcexpandparam extendedglob unset\n  unsetopt markdirs globsubst shwordsplit shglob ksharrays cshnullglob\n  unsetopt allexport aliases errexit octalzeroes\nbut that by no means exhausts the possibilities. Actually, it doesn\\'t\ninclude those lines: the options to set are stored in the array\n$_comp_options, with NO_ in front if they are to be turned off. You\ncan modify this if you find you need to (and maybe tell the maintainers,\ntoo).\nBy the way, if you are wondering whether you can re-use the function\n_main_complete, by binding it to a different key with slightly\ndifferent completion definitions, look instead at the description of the\n_generic command widget below. It\\'s just a front-end to\n_main_complete which allows you to have a different set of styles in\neffect.\n[]{#l147}\n6.2.1: Ambiguous completions\nThe largest group of options deals with what happens when a completion\nis ambiguous, in other words there is more than one possible completion.\nThe seven relevant options are as follows, as copied from the FAQ; many\ndifferent combinations are possible:\n\nwith NO_BEEP set, that annoying beep goes away,\nwith NO_LIST_BEEP, beeping is only turned off for ambiguous\ncompletions,\nwith AUTO_LIST set, when the completion is ambiguous you get a\nlist without having to type ^D,\nwith BASH_AUTO_LIST set, the list only happens the second time you\nhit tab on an ambiguous completion,\nwith LIST_AMBIGUOUS, this is modified so that nothing is listed if\nthere is an unambiguous prefix or suffix to be inserted --- this\ncan be combined with BASH_AUTO_LIST, so that where both are\napplicable you need to hit tab three times for a listing,\nwith REC_EXACT, if the string on the command line exactly matches\none of the possible completions, it is accepted, even if there is\nanother completion (i.e. that string with something else added) that\nalso matches,\nwith MENU_COMPLETE set, one completion is always inserted\ncompletely, then when you hit TAB it changes to the next, and so on\nuntil you get back to where you started,\nwith AUTO_MENU, you only get the menu behaviour when you hit TAB\nagain on the ambiguous completion.\n\n[]{#l148}\n6.2.2: ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\nThe option ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT is set by default, and has been since an\nearlier 3.1 release of zsh; after listing a completion, the cursor is\ntaken back to the line it was on before, instead of reprinting it\nunderneath. The downside of this is that the listing will be obscured\nwhen you execute the command or produce a different listing, so you may\nwant to unset the option. ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT behaviour is required for\nmenu selection to work, which is why I mention it now instead of in the\nragbag below.\nWhen you\\'re writing your own editor functions which invoke completion,\nyou can actually cancel the effect of this with the widget\nend-of-list, which you would call as zle end-of-list (it\\'s a normal\nediting function, not a completion function). You can also bind it to a\nkey to use to preserve the existing completion list. On the other hand,\nif you want to control the behaviour within a completion function, i.e.\nto decide whether completion will try to return to the prompt above the\nlist, you can manipulate it with the last_prompt element of the\n$compstate associative array, so for example:\n  compstate[last_prompt]=''\nwill turn off the behaviour for the completion in progress. $compstate\nis the place to turn if you find yourself wanting to control completion\nbehaviour in this much detail; see the zshcompwid manual page.\n[]{#l149}\n6.2.3: Menu completion and menu selection\nThe most significant matter decided by the options above is whether or\nnot you are using menu completion. If you are not, you will need to type\nthe next character explicitly when completion is ambiguous; if you are,\nyou just need to keep hitting tab until the completion you want appears.\nIn the second case, of course, this works best if there are not too many\npossibilities. Use of AUTO_MENU or binding the menu-complete widget\nto a separate key-stroke gives you something of both worlds.\nA new variant of menu completion appeared in 3.1.6; in fact, it deserves\nthe name menu completion rather more than the original form, but since\nthat name was taken it is called `menu selection\\'. This allows you to\nmove the cursor around the list of completions to select one. It is\nimplemented by a separate module, zsh/complist; you can make sure this\nis loaded by putting `zmodload -i zsh/complist\\' in .zshrc,\nalthough it should be loaded automatically when the style menu is set\nas below. For it to be useful, you need two other things. The first is\nALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT behaviour; this is suppressed if the whole\ncompletion list won\\'t appear on the screen, since there\\'s no line on\nthe screen to go back to. However, menu selection does still work, by\nallowing you to scroll the list up and down. The second thing is that\nyou need to start menu completion in any of the usual ways; menu\nselection is an addition to menu completion, not a replacement.\nNow you should set the following style:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=\nIf an ambiguous completion produces at least  possibilities, menu\nselection is started. You can understand this best by trying it. One of\nthe completions in the list, initially the top-leftmost, is highlighted\nand inserted into the line. By moving the cursor in the obvious\ndirections (with wraparound at the edges), you change both the value\nhighlighted and the value inserted into the line. When you have the\nvalue you want, hit return, which removes the list and leaves the\ninserted value. Hitting ^G (the editor function send-break) aborts\nmenu selection, removes the list and restores the command line.\nInternally, zsh actually uses the parameter $MENUSELECT to supply the\nnumber and hence start menu selection. However, this is always\ninitialised from the style as defined above, so you shouldn\\'t set\n$MENUSELECT directly (unless you are using compctl, which will\nhappily use menu selection). As with other styles, you can specify\ndifferent values for different contexts; the default tag is checked if\nthe current context does not produce a value for the style with whatever\nthe current tag is. Note that the menu style also allows you to\ncontrol whether menu completion is started at all, with or without\nselection; in other words, it is a style corresponding to the\nMENU_COMPLETE option.\nThere is one other additional feature when using menu selection. The zle\ncommand accept-and-infer-next-history has a different meaning here; it\naccepts a completion, and then tries to complete again using menu\nselection. This is very useful with directory hierarchies, and in\ncombination with undo gives you a simple file browser. You need to\nbind it in the special keymap menuselect; for example, I use\n  bindkey -M menuselect '^o' accept-and-infer-next-history\nbecause the behaviour reminds me of what is usually bound to ^O in\nemacs modes, namely accept-line-and-down-history. Binding it like this\nhas no effect on ^O in the normal keymaps. Try it out by entering menu\nselection on a set of files including directories, and typing ^O on\none of the directories. You should immediately have the contents of that\ndirectory presented for the next selection, while undo is smart enough\nnot only to remove that selection but return to completion on the parent\ndirectory.\nYou can choose the manner in which the currently selected value in the\ncompletion list is highlighted using exactly the same mechanism as for\nspecifying colours for particular types of matches; see the description\nof the list-colors style below.\n[]{#l150}\n6.2.4: Other ways of changing completion behaviour\nCOMPLETE_ALIASES\\\nIf you set an alias such as\n  alias pu=pushd\nthen the alias `pu\\' will be expanded when the completion system is\nlooking for the name of the command, so that it will instead find the\ncommand name `pushd\\'. This is quite useful to avoid having to define\nextra completions for all your aliases. However, it\\'s possible you may\nwant to define something different for the alias than for the command it\nexpands to. In that case, you will need to set COMPLETE_ALIASES, and\nto make arrangements for completing after every alias which does not\nalready match the name of a command. Hence `alias zcat=\"myzcat -dc\"\\'\nwill work with the option set, even if you haven\\'t told the system\nabout `myzcat\\', while `alias myzcat=\"gzip -dc\"\\' will not work\nunless you do define a completion for myzcat: here\n`compdef _gzip myzcat\\' would probably be good enough. Without the\noption set, it would be the other way around: the first alias would not\nwork without the extra compdef, but the second would.\nAUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\\\nThis option is turned on by default. If you complete a directory name\nand a slash is added --- which it usually is, both to tell you that\nyou have completed a directory and to allow you to complete files inside\nit without adding a `/\\' by hand --- and the next thing you type is\nnot something which would insert or complete part of a file in that\ndirectory, then the slash is removed. Hence:\n % rmdir my\n   ->  rmdir mydir/\n % rmdir mydir/\n   ->  `rmdir mydir' executed\nThis example shows why this behaviour was added: some versions of\n`rmdir\\' baulk at having the slash after the directory name. On the\nother hand, if you continued typing after the slash, or hit tab again to\ncomplete inside mydir, then the slash would remain.\nThis is at worst harmless under most circumstances. However, you can\nunset the option AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH if you don\\'t like that behaviour.\nOne thing that may cause slight confusion, although it is the same as\nwith other suffixes (i.e. bits which get added automatically but aren\\'t\npart of the value being completed), is that the slash is added straight\naway if the value is being inserted by menu completion. This might cause\nyou to think wrongly that the completion is finished, and hence is\nunique when in fact it isn\\'t.\nNote that some forms of completion have this type of behaviour built in,\nnot necessarily with a slash, when completing lists of arguments. For\nexample, enter `typeset ZSH_V\\' and you will see\n`ZSH_VERSION=\\' appear, in case you want to assign something to the\nparameter; hitting space, which is not a possible value, makes the\n`=\\' disappear. This is not controlled by the AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH\noption, which applies only to directories inserted by the standard\nfilename completion system.\nAUTO_PARAM_SLASH, AUTO_PARAM_KEYS\\\nThese options come into effect when completing expressions with\nparameter substitutions. If AUTO_PARAM_SLASH is set, then any\nparameter expression whose value is the name of a directory will have a\nslash appended when completed, just as if the value itself had been\ninserted by the completion system.\nThe behaviour for AUTO_PARAM_KEYS is a bit more complicated. Try this:\n  print ${ZSH_V\nYou will find that you get the complete word `${ZSH_VERSION}\\', with\nthe closing brace and (assuming there are no other matching parameters)\na space afterwards. However, often after you have completed a parameter\nin this fashion you want to type something immediately after it, such as\na subscript. With AUTO_PARAM_KEYS, if you type something at this point\nwhich seems likely to have to go after the parameter name, it will\nimmediately be put there without you having to delete the intervening\ncharacters --- try it with `[\\', for example. Note that this only\nhappens if the parameter name and any extra bits were added by\ncompletion; if you type everything by hand, typing `[\\' will not have\nthis magic effect.\nCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\\\nIf this is set, completion always takes place at the cursor position in\nthe word. For example if you typed `Mafile\\', went back over the\n`f\\', and hit tab, the shell would complete `Makefile\\', instead\nof its usual behaviour of going to the end of the word and trying to\nfind a completion there, i.e. something matching `Mafile*\\'. Some\nsorts of new completion (such as filename completion) seem to implement\nthis behaviour regardless of the option setting; some other features\n(such as the `_prefix\\' completer described below) require it, so\nit\\'s a good thing to set and get used to, unless you really need to\ncomplete only at the end of the word.\nALWAYS_TO_END\\\nIf this is set, the cursor is always moved to the end of the word after\nit is completed, even if completion took place in the middle. This also\nhappens with menu completion.\n[]{#l151}\n6.2.5: Changing the way completions are displayed\nLIST_TYPES\\\nThis is like the -F option to ls; files which appear in the\ncompletion listing have a trailing `/\\' for a directory, `*\\' for\na regular file executable by the current process, `@\\' for a link,\n`|\\' for a named pipe, `%\\' for a character device and `#\\' for\na block device. This option is on by default.\nNote that the identifiers only appear if the completion system knows\nthat the item is supposed to be a file. This is automatic if the usual\nfilename completion commands are used. There is also an option -f to\nthe builtin compadd if you write your own completion function and want\nto tell the shell that the values may be existing files to apply\nLIST_TYPES to (though no harm is caused if no such files exist).\nLIST_PACKED, LIST_ROWS_FIRST\\\nThese affect the arrangement of the completion listing. With\nLIST_PACKED, completion lists are made as compact as possible by\nvarying the widths of the columns, instead of formatting them into a\ncompletely regular grid. With LIST_ROWS_FIRST, the listing order is\nchanged so that adjacent items appear along rows instead of down\ncolumns, rather like ls\\'s -x option.\nIt is possible to alter both these for particular contexts using the\nstyles list-packed and list-rows-first. The styles in such cases\nalways override the option; the option setting is used if no\ncorresponding style is found.\nNote also the discussion of completion groups later on: it is possible\nto have different types of completion appear in separate lists, which\nmay then be formatted differently using these tag-sensitive styles.\n[]{#l152}\n6.3: Getting started with new completion\nBefore I go into any detail about new completion, here\\'s how to set it\nup so that you can try it out. As I said above, the basic objects that\ndo completions are shell functions. These are all autoloaded, so the\nshell needs to know where to find them via the $fpath array. If the\nshell was installed properly, and nothing in the initialization files\nhas removed the required bits from $fpath, this should happen\nautomatically. It\\'s even possible your system sets up completion for\nyou (Mandrake Linux 6.1 is the first system known to do this out of the\nbox), in which case type `which compdef\\' and you should see a\ncomplete shell function --- actually the one which allows you to\ndefine additional completion functions. Then you can skip the next\nparagraph.\nIf you want to load completion, try this at the command line:\n  autoload -U compinit\n  compinit\nwhich should work silently. If not, you need to ask your system\nadministrator what has happened to the completion functions or find them\nyourself, and then add all the required directories to your $fpath.\nEither they will all be in one big directory, or in a set of\nsubdirectories with the names AIX, BSD, Base, Debian, Redhat,\nUnix, X and Zsh; in the second case, all the directories need to\nbe in $fpath. When this works, you can add the same lines, including\nany modification of $fpath you needed, to your .zshrc.\nYou can now see if it\\'s actually working. Type `cd\\', then ^D,\nand you should be presented with a list of directories only, no regular\nfiles. If you have $cdpath set, you may see directories that don\\'t\nappear with ls. As this suggests, the completion system is supplied\nwith completions for many common (and some quite abstruse) commands.\nIndeed, the idea is that for most users completion just works without\nintervention most of the time. If you think it should when it doesn\\'t,\nit may be a bug or an oversight, and you should report it.\nAnother example on the theme of `it just works\\':\n  tar xzf archive.tar.gz ^D\nwill look inside the gzipped tar archive --- assuming the GNU version\nof tar, for which the `z\\' in the first set of arguments reports\nthat the archive has been compressed with gzip --- and give you a list\nof files or directories you can extract. This is done in a very similar\nway to normal file completion; although there are differences, you can\ndo completion down to any directory depth within the archive. (At this\npoint, you\\'re supposed to be impressed.)\nThe completion system knows about more than just commands and their\narguments, it also understands some of the shell syntax. For example,\nthere\\'s an associative array called $_comps which stores the names of\ncommands as keys and the names of completion functions as the\ncorresponding values. Try typing:\n  print ${_comps[\nand then ^D. You\\'ll probably get a message asking if you really want\nto see all the possible completions, i.e. the keys for $_comps; if you\nsay `y\\' you\\'ll see a list. If you insert any of those keys, then\nclose the braces so you have e.g. `${_comps[mozilla]}\\' and hit\nreturn, you\\'ll see the completion function which handles that command;\nin this case (at the time of writing) it\\'s _webbrowser. This is one\nway of finding out what function is handling a particular command. If\nthere is no entry --- i.e. the `print ${_comps[mycmd]}\\' gives you\na blank line --- then the command is not handled specially and will\nsimply use whatever function is defined for the `-default-\\' context,\nusually _default. Usually this will just try to complete file names.\nYou can customize _default, if you like.\nApart from -default-, some other of those keys for _comps also look\nlike -this-: they are special contexts, places other than the\narguments of a command. We were using the context called -subscript-;\nyou\\'ll find that the function in this case is called _subscript. Many\ncompletion functions have names which are simply an underscore followed\nby the command or context name, minus any hyphens. If you want a taster\nof how a completion function looks, try `which _subscript\\'; you may\nwell find there are a lot of other commands in there that you don\\'t\nknow yet.\nIt\\'s important to remember that the function found in this way is at\nthe root of how a completion is performed. No amount of fiddling with\noptions or styles --- the stuff I\\'m going to be talking about for the\nnext few sections --- will change that; if you want to change the\nbasic completion, you will just have to write your own function.\nBy the way, you may have old-style completions you want to mix-in ---\nor maybe you specifically don\\'t want to mix them in so that you can\nmake sure everything is working with the new format. By default, the new\ncompletion system will first try to find a specific new-style\ncompletion, and if it can\\'t it will try to find a compctl-defined\ncompletion for the command in question. If all that fails, it will try\nthe usual new-style default completion, probably just filename\ncompletion. Note that specific new-style completions take precedence,\nwhich is fair enough, since if you\\'ve added them you almost certainly\ndon\\'t want to go back and use the old form. However, if you don\\'t ever\nwant to try old-style completion, you can put the following incantation\nin your .zshrc:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' use-compctl false\nFor now, that\\'s just black magic, but later I will explain the\n`style\\' mechanism in more detail and you will see that this fits in\nwith the normal way of turning things off in new-style completion.\n[]{#l153}\n6.4: How the shell finds the right completions\n[]{#l154}\n6.4.1: Contexts\nThe examples above show that the completion system is highly\ncontext-sensitive, so it\\'s important to know how these contexts are\ndescribed. This system evolved gradually, but everything I say applies\nto all versions of zsh with the major version 4.\nstate we are at in completion, and is given as a sort of colon-separated\npath, starting with the least specific part. There\\'s an easy way of\nfinding out what context you are in: at the point where you want to\ncomplete something, instead type `^Xh\\', and it will tell you. In the\ncase of the $_comps example, you will find,\n  :completion::complete:-subscript-::\nplus a list of so-called `tags\\' and completion functions, which I\\'ll\ntalk about later. The full form is:\n  :completion:::::\nwhere the elements may be missing if they are not set, but the colons\nwill always be there to make pattern matching easier. Here\\'s what the\nbits of the context mean after the :completion: part, which is common\nto the whole completion system.\n\\\n:   is the name of a function from which completion is called --- this\n    is blank if it was started from the standard completion system, and\n    only appears in a few special cases, listed in section six of this\n    chapter.\n\\\n:   is called `complete\\' in this case: this refers to the fact that\n    the completion system can do more than just simple completion; for\n    example, it can do a more controlled form of expansion (as I\n    mentioned), spelling correction, and completing words with spelling\n    mistakes. I\\'ll introduce the other completers later; `complete\\'\n    is the simplest one, which just does basic completion.\n\\\n:   is the name of a command or other similar context as described\n    above, here `-subscript-\\'.\n\\\n:   is most useful when  is the name of a real command; it\n    describes where in the arguments to that command we are. You\\'ll see\n    how it works in a moment. Many of the simpler completions don\\'t use\n    this; only the ones with complicated option and argument\n    combinations. You just have to find out with ^Xh if you need to\n    know.\n\\\n:   describes the type of a completion, essentially a way of\n    discriminating between the different things which can be completed\n    at the same point on the command line.\nNow look at the context for a more normal command-argument completion,\ne.g. after cd; here you\\'ll see the context\n`:completion::complete:cd::\\'. Here the command-name part of the\ncontext is a real command.\nFor something more complicated, try after `cvs add\\' (it doesn\\'t\nmatter for this if you don\\'t have the cvs command). You\\'ll see a\nlong and repetitive list of tags, for two possible contexts,\n  :completion::complete:cvs:argument-rest:\n  :completion::complete:cvs-add:argument-rest:\nThe reason you have both is that the `add\\' is not only an argument\nto cvs, as the first context would suggest, it\\'s also a subcommand in\nits own right, with its own arguments, and that\\'s what the second\ncontext is for. The first context implies there might be more\nsubcommands after `add\\' and its arguments which are completely\nseparate from them --- though in fact CVS doesn\\'t work that way, so\nthat form won\\'t give you any completions here.\nIn both, `argument-rest\\' shows that completion is looking for\nanother argument, the `rest\\' indicating that it is the list of\narguments at the end of the line; if position were important (see\n`cvs import\\' for an example), the context would contain\n`argument-1\\', or whatever. The `cvs-add\\' shows how subcommands\nare handled, by separating with a hyphen instead of a colon, so as not\nto confuse the different bits of the context.\nApart from arguments to commands and subcommands, arguments to options\nare another frequent possibility; for an example of this, try typing\n^Xh after `dvips -o\\' and you will see the context\n`:completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:\\'; this shows you are\ncompleting the first argument to dvips\\'s -o option, (it only takes\none argument) which happens to be the name of a file for output.\n[]{#l155}\n6.4.2: Tags\nNow on to the other matter to do with contexts, tags. Let\\'s go back and\nlook at the output from the ^Xh help test after the cd command in\nfull:\n  tags in context :completion::complete:cd::\n    local-directories path-directories  (_alternative _cd)\nUnlike the contexts considered so far, which tell you how completion\narrived at the point it did, the tags describe the things it can\ncomplete here. In this case, there are three: directory-stack refers\nto entries such as `+1\\'; the directory stack is the set of\ndirectories defined by using the pushd command, which you can see by\nusing the dirs command. Next, local-directories refers to\nsubdirectories of the current working directory, while\npath-directories refers to any directories found by searching the\n$cdpath array. Each of the possible completions which the system\noffers belongs to one of those classes.\nIn parentheses, you see the names of the functions which were called to\ngenerate the completions; these are what you need to change or replace\nif you want to alter the basic completion behaviour. Calling functions\nappear on the right and called functions on the left, so that in this\ncase the function `_cd\\' was the function first called to handle\narguments for the cd command, fitting the usual convention. Some\nstandard completion functions have been filtered out of this list ---\nit wouldn\\'t help you to know it had been through _main_complete and\n_complete, for example.\nMaybe it\\'s already obvious that having the system treat different types\nof completion in different ways is useful, but here\\'s an example, which\ngives you a preview of the `styles\\' mechanism, discussed later. Styles\nare a sort of glorified shell parameter; they are defined with the\nzstyle command, using a style name and possible values which may be an\narray; you can always define a style as an array, but some styles may\nsimply use it as a string, joining together the arguments you gave it\nwith spaces. You can also use the zstyle command, with different\narguments, to retrieve their value, which is what the completion system\nitself does; there\\'s no actual overlap with parameters and their\nvalues, so they don\\'t get in the way of normal shell programming.\nWhere styles differ from parameters is that they can take different\nvalues in different contexts. The first argument to the zstyle command\ngives a context; when you define a style, this argument is actually a\npattern which will be matched against the current context to see if the\nstyle applies. The rule for finding out what applies is: exact string\nmatches are preferred before patterns, and longer patterns are preferred\nbefore shorter patterns. Here\\'s that example:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:cd:*' tag-order local-directories \\ \n    path-directories\nFrom the discussion of contexts above, the pattern will match any time\nan argument to the cd command is being completed. The style being set\nis called tag-order, and the values are the two tags valid for\ndirectories in cd.\nThe tag-order style determines the order in which tags are tried. The\nvalue given above means that first local-directories will be\ncompleted; only if none can be completed will path-directories be\ntried. You can enter the command and try this; if you don\\'t have\n$cdpath set up you can assign `cdpath=(~)\\', which will allow\n`cd foo\\' to change to a directory `~/foo\\' and allow completion\nof directories accordingly. Go to a directory other than ~; completion\nfor cd will only show subdirectories of where you are, not those of\n~, unless you type a string which is the prefix of a directory under\n~ but not your current directory. For example,\n  % cdpath=(~)\n  % ls -F ~\n  foo/    bar/\n  % ls -F\n  rod/    stick/\n  # Without that tag-order zstyle command, you would get...\n  % cd ^D\n  bar/    foo/    rod/    stick/\n  % zstyle ':completion:*:cd:*' tag-order local-directories \\ \n     path-directories\n  # now you just get the local directories, if there are any...\n  % cd ^D\n  rod/    stick/\nThere\\'s more you can do with the tag-order style: if you put the tags\ninto the same word by quoting, for example\n\"local-directories path-directories\", then they would be tried at the\nsame time, which in this case gives you the effect of the default. In\nfact, since it\\'s too much work to know what tags are going to be\navailable for every single possible completion, the default when there\nis no appropriate tag-order is simply to try all the tags available in\nthe context at once; this was of course what was originally happening\nfor completion after cd.\nEven if there is a tag-order specification, any tags not specified\nwill usually be tried all together at the end, so you could actually\nhave missed out path-directories from the end of the original example\nand the effect would have been the same. If you don\\'t want that to\nhappen, you can specify a `-\\' somewhere in the list of tags, which\nis not used as a tag but tells completion that only the tags in the list\nshould be tried, not any others that may be available. Also, if you\ndon\\'t want a particular tag to be shown you can include `!tagname\\'\nin the values, and all the others but this will be included. For\nexample, you may have noticed that when completing in command position\nyou are offered parameters to set as well as commands etc.:\n  Completing external command\n  tex             texhash         texi2pdf        text2sf\n  texconfig       texi2dvi        texindex        textmode\n  texdoc          texi2dvi4a2ps   texlinks        texutil\n  texexec         texi2html       texshow         texview\n  Completing parameter\n  TEXINPUTS                               texinputs\n(I haven\\'t told you how to produce those descriptions, or how to make\nthe completions for different tags appear separately, but I will ---\nsee the descriptions of the `format\\' and `group-name\\' styles\nbelow.) If you set\n  zstyle ':completion:*:-command-:*' tag-order '!parameters'\nthen the last two lines will disappear from the completion. Of course,\nyour completion list probably looks completely different from mine\nanyway. By the way, one good thing about styles is that it doesn\\'t\nmatter whether they\\'re defined before or after completion is loaded,\nsince styles are stored and retrieved by another part of the shell.\nTo exclude more than one tag name, you need to include the names in the\nsame word. For example, to exclude both parameters and reserved words\nthe value would be '!parameters reserved-words', and not\n'!parameters' '!reserved-words', which would try completion once with\nparameters excluded, then again with reserved words excluded.\nFurthermore, tags can actually be patterns, or more precisely any word\nin one of the arguments to tag-order may contain a pattern, which will\nthen be tried against all the valid tags to see if it matches. It\\'s\nsometimes even useful to use `*\\' to match all tags, if you are\nspecifying a special form of one of the tags --- maybe using a label,\nas described next --- in the same word. See the manual for all the tag\nnames understood by the supplied functions.\nThe tag-order style allows you to give tags `labels\\', which are a\nsort of alias, instructing the completion system to use a tag under a\ndifferent name. You arrange this by giving the tag followed by a colon,\nfollowed by the label. The label can also have a hyphen in front, which\nmeans that the original tag name should be put in front when the label\nis looked up; this is really just a way of making the names look neater.\nThe upshot is that by using contexts with the label name in, rather than\nthe tag name, you can arrange for special behaviour. Furthermore, you\ncan give an alternative description for the labelled tag; these show up\nwith the format style which I\\'ll describe below (and which I\npersonally find very useful). You put the description after another\ncolon, with any spaces quoted. It would look like this:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:aliens:*' tag-order \\ \n  'frooble:-funny:funny\\ frooble' frooble\nwhich is used when you\\'re completing for the command aliens, which\npresumably has completions tagged as `frooble\\' (if not, you\\'re very\nweird). Then completion will first look up styles for that tag under the\nname frooble-funny, and if it finds completions using those styles it\nwill list them with a description (if you are using format) of `funny\nfrooble\\'. Otherwise, it will look up the styles for the tag under its\nusual name and try completion again. It\\'s presumably obvious that if\nyou don\\'t have different styles for the two labels of the tag, you get\nthe same completions each time.\nRather than overload you with information on tags by giving examples of\nhow to use tag labels now, I\\'ll reserve this for the description of the\nignored-patterns style below, which is one neat use for labels. In\nfact, it\\'s the one for which it was invented; there are probably lots\nof other ones we haven\\'t thought of yet.\nOne important note about tag-order which I may not have made as\nexplicit as I should have: it doesn\\'t change which tags are actually\nvalid in that completion. Just putting a tag name into the list\ndoesn\\'t mean that tag name will be used; that\\'s determined entirely by\nthe completion functions for a particular context. The tag-order style\nsimply alters the order in which the tags which are valid are\nexamined. Come back and read this paragraph again when you can\\'t work\nout why tag-order isn\\'t doing what you want.\nNote that the rule for testing patterns means that you can always\nspecify a catch-all worst case by `zstyle \"*\" style ...\\', which will\nalways be tried last --- not just in completion, in fact, since other\nparts of the shell use the styles mechanism, and without the\n`:completion:\\' at the start of the context this style definition\nwill be picked up there, too.\nStyles like tag-order are the most important case where tags are used\non their own. In other cases, they can be added to the end of the\ncontext; this is useful for styles which can give different results for\ndifferent sets of completions, in particular styles that determine how\nthe list of completions is displayed, or how a completion is to be\ninserted into the command line. The tag is the final element, so is not\nfollowed by a colon. A full context then looks something like\n`:completion::complete:cd::path-directories\\'. Later, you\\'ll see\nsome styles which can usefully be different for different tag contexts.\nRemember, however, that the tags part of the context, like other parts,\nmay be empty if the completion system hasn\\'t figured out what it should\nbe yet.\n[]{#l156}\n6.5: Configuring completion using styles\nYou now know how to define a style for a particular context, using\n  zstyle   \nand some of the cases where it\\'s useful. Before introducing other\nstyles, here\\'s some more detailed information. I already said that\nstyles could take an array value, i.e. a set of values at the end of the\nzstyle command corresponding to the array elements, and you\\'ve\nalready seen one case (tag-order) where that is useful. Many styles\nonly use one value, however. There is a particularly common case, where\nyou simply want to turn a value on or off, i.e. a boolean value. In this\ncase, you can use any of `true\\', `yes\\', `on\\' or `1\\' for\non and `false\\', `no\\', `off\\' or `0\\' for off. You define\nall styles the same way; only when they\\'re used is it decided whether\nthey should be a scalar, an array, or a boolean, nor is the name of a\nstyle checked to see if it is valid, since the shell doesn\\'t know what\nstyles might later be looked up. The same obviously goes for contexts.\nYou can list existing styles (not individually, only as a complete list)\nusing either `zstyle\\' or `zstyle -L\\'. In the second case, they\nare output as the set of zstyle commands which would regenerate the\nstyles currently defined. This is also useful with grep, since you can\neasily check all possible contexts for a particular style.\nThe most powerful way of using zstyle is with the option -e. This\nsays that the words you supply are to be evaluated as if as arguments to\neval. This should set the array $reply to the words to be used. So\n  zstyle '*' days 'Monday Tuesday'\nand\n  zstyle -e '*' days 'reply=(Monday Tuesday)'\nare equivalent --- but the intention, of course, is that in the second\ncase the argument can return a different value each time so that the\nstyle can vary. It will usually be evaluated in the heat of completion,\nhence picking up all the editing parameters; so for example\n  zstyle -e ':completion:*' mystyles 'reply=(${NUMERIC:-0})'\nwill make the style return a non-zero integer (possibly indicating\ntrue) if you entered a non-zero prefix argument to the command, as\ndescribed in chapter 4. However, the argument can\ncontain any zsh code whatsoever, not just a simple assignment. Remember\nto quote it to prevent it from being turned into something else when the\nzstyle command line is run.\nFinally, you can delete a context for a style or a list of styles by\n  zstyle -d [  [  ] ] ...\n--- note that although the first argument is a pattern, in this case\nit is treated exactly, so if you give the pattern\n`:completion:*:cd:*\\', only values given with exactly that pattern\nwill be deleted, not other values whose context begins with\n`:completion:\\' and contains `:cd:\\'. The pattern and the style\nare optional when deleting; if omitted, all styles for the context, or\nall styles of any sort, are deleted. The completion system has its own\ndefaults, but these are builtin, so anything you specify takes\nprecedence.\nBy the way, I did mention in passing in chapter 4\nthat you could use styles in just the same way in ordinary zle widgets\n(the ones created with `zle -N\\'), but you probably forgot about that\nstraight away. All the instructions about defining styles and using them\nin your own functions from this chapter apply to zle functions. The only\ndifference is that in that case the convention for contexts is that the\ncontext is set to `:zle:widget-name\\' for executing the widget\nwidget-name.\nThe rest of this section describes some useful styles. It\\'s up to you\nto experiment with contexts if you want the style\\'s values to be\ndifferent in different places, or just use `*\\' if you don\\'t care.\n[]{#l157}\n6.5.1: Specifying completers and their options\n`Completers\\' are the behind-the-scenes functions that decide what sort\nof completion is being done. You set what completers to use with the\n`completer\\' style, which takes an array of completers to try in\norder. For example,\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _correct _approximate\nspecifies that first normal completion will be tried (`_complete\\'),\nthen spelling correction (`_correct\\'), and finally approximate\ncompletion (`_approximate\\'), which is essentially the combined\neffect of the previous two, i.e. complete the word typed but allow for\nspelling mistakes. All completers set the context, so inside _complete\nyou will usually find `:completion::complete:...\\', inside correction\n`:completion::correct:..\\', and so on.\nThere\\'s a labelling feature for completers, rather like the one for\ntags described, but not illustrated in detail, above. You can put a\ncompleter in a list like this:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer ... _complete:comp-label ...\nwhich calls the completer _complete, but pretends its name is\ncomp-label when looking things up in styles, so you can try completers\nmore than once with different features enabled. As with tags, you can\nwrite it like `_complete:-label\\', and the normal name will be\nprepended to get the name `complete-label\\' --- just a shortcut, it\ndoesn\\'t introduce anything new. I\\'ll defer an example until you know\nwhat the completers do.\nHere is a more detailed description of the existing completers; they are\nall functions, so you can simply copy and modify one to make your own\ncompleter.\n_complete\\\nThis is the basic completion behaviour, which we\\'ve been assuming up to\nnow. Its major use is simply to check the context --- here meaning\nwhether we are completing a normal command argument or one of the\nspecial `-context-\\' places --- and call the appropriate completion\nfunction. It\\'s possible to trick it by setting the parameter\n`compcontext\\' which will be used instead of the one generated\nautomatically; this can be useful if you write your own completion\ncommands for special cases. If you do this, you should make the\nparameter local to your function.\n_approximate\\\nThis does approximate completion: it\\'s actually written as a wrapper\nfor the _complete completer, so it does all the things that does, but\nit also sets up the system to allow completions with misspellings.\nTypically, you would want to try to complete without misspellings first,\nso this completer usually appears after _complete in the completers\nstyle.\nThe main means of control is via the max-errors style. You can set\nthis to the maximum number of errors to allow. An error is defined as\ndescribed in the manual for approximate pattern matching: a character\nmissing such as `rhythm\\' / `rhytm\\', an extra character such as\n`rhythm\\' / `rhythms\\', an incorrect character such as\n`rhythm\\' / `rhxthm\\', or a pair of characters transposed such as\n`rhythm\\' `rhyhtm\\' each count as one error. Approximation will\nfirst try to find a match or matches with one error, then two errors,\nand so on, up to and including the value of max-errors; the set of\nmatches with the lowest number of errors is chosen, so that even if you\nset max-errors large, matches with a lower number of errors will\nalways be preferred. The real problems with setting a large max-errors\nare that it will be slower, and is more likely to generate matches\ncompletely unlike what you want --- with typing errors, two or three\nare probably the most you need. Otherwise, there\\'s always Mavis Beacon.\nHence:\n  % zstyle ':completion:*' max-errors 2\n  # just for the sake of example...\n  % zstyle ':completion:*' completer _approximate\n  % ls\n  ashes    sackcloth\n  % echo siccl\n    -> echo sackcloth\n  % echo zicc\n    \nbecause `s[i/a]c[k]cloth\\' is only two errors, while\n`[z/s][i/a]c[k]cloth\\' would be three, so doesn\\'t complete.\nThere\\'s another way to give a maximum number of errors, using the\nnumeric prefix specified with ESC- in Emacs mode, directly with\nnumber keys in vi command mode, or with universal-argument. To enable\nthis, you have to include the string numeric as one of the values for\nmax-errors --- hence this can actually be an array, e.g.\n  zstyle ':completion:*:approximate:*' max-errors 2 numeric\nallows up to two errors automatically, but you can specify a higher\nmaximum by giving a prefix to the completion command. So to continue the\nexample above, enter the new zstyle and:\n  % echo zicc\n    -> echo sackcloth\nbecause we\\'ve allowed three errors. You can start to see the problems\nwith allowing too many errors: if you had the file `zucchini\\', that\nwould be only one error away, and would be found and inserted before\n`sackcloth\\' was even considered.\nNote that the context is examined straightaway in the completer, so at\nthis stage it is simply `:completion::approximate:::\\'; no more\ndetailed contextual information is available, so it is not possible to\nspecify different max-errors for different commands or tags.\nThe final possibility as a value for the style is `not-numeric\\':\nthat means if any numeric prefix is given, approximation will not be\ndone at all. In the last example, completion would have to find a file\nbeginning `zicc\\'.\nOther minor styles also control approximation. The style original, if\ntrue means the original value is always treated as a possible\ncompletion, even if it doesn\\'t match anything and even if nothing else\nmatched. Completing the original and the corrections use different tags,\nunimaginatively called original and corrections, so you can organise\nthis with the tag-order style.\nBecause the completions in this case usually don\\'t match what\\'s\nalready on the command line, and may well not match each other, menu\ncompletion is entered straight away for you to pick a completion. You\ncan arrange that this doesn\\'t happen if there is an unambiguous piece\nat the start to insert first by setting the boolean style\ninsert-unambiguous.\nThose last two styles (original and insert-unambiguous) are looked\nup quite early on, when the context for generating corrections is being\nset up, so that only the context up to the completer name is available.\nThe completer name will be followed by a hyphen and the number of errors\ncurrently being accepted. So for trying approximation with one error the\ncontext is `:completion::approximate-1:::\\'; if that fails and the\nsystem needs to look for completion with two errors, the context will be\n`:completion::approximate-2:::\\', and so on; the same happens with\ncorrection and `correct-1\\', etc., for the completer described next.\n_correct\\\nThis is very similar to _approximate, except that the context is\n`:completion::correct:*\\' (or `:completion::correct-:*\\' when\ngenerating corrections, as described immediately above) and it won\\'t\nperform completion, just spelling correction, so extra characters which\nthe completer has to add at the end of the word on the line now count as\nextra errors instead of completing in the ordinary way: zicc is\nwoefully far from sackcloth, seven errors, but ziccloth only counts\nthree again. The _correct completer is controlled in just the same way\nas _approximate.\nThere is a separate command which only does correction and nothing else,\nusually bound to `^Xc\\', so if you are happy using that you don\\'t\nneed to include _correct in the list of completers. If you do include\nit, and you also have _approximate, _correct should come earlier;\n_approximate is bound to generate all the matches _correct does, and\nprobably more. Like other separate completion commands, it has its own\ncontext, here beginning `:completion:correct-word:\\', so it\\'s easy\nto make this command behave differently from the normal completers.\nOld-timers will remember that there is another form of spelling\ncorrection built into the shell, called with `ESC-$\\' or `ESC-s\\'.\nThis only corrects filenames and doesn\\'t understand anything about the\nnew completion mechanism; the only reason for using it is that it may\nwell be faster. However, if you use the CORRECT or CORRECT_ALL shell\noptions, you will be using the old filename correction mechanism; it\\'s\nnot yet possible to alter this.\n_expand\\\nThis actually performs expansion, not completion; the difference was\nexplained at the start of the chapter. If you use it, you should bind\ntab to complete-word, not expand-or-complete, since otherwise\nexpansion will be performed before the completion mechanism is started\nup. As expansion should still usually be attempted before completion,\nthis completer should appear before _complete and its relatives in the\nlist of values for the completers style.\nThe reason for using this completer instead of normal expansion is that\nyou can control which expansions are performed using styles in the\n`:completion:*:expand:*\\' context. Here are the relevant styles:\nglob\n:   expands glob expressions, in other words does filename generation\n    using wildcards.\nsubstitute\n:   expands expressions including and active `$\\' or backquotes.\nBut remember that you need\n  bindkey '^i' complete-word\nwhen using this completer as otherwise the built-in expansion mechanism\nwhich is run by the normal binding expand-or-complete will take over.\nYou can also control how expansions are inserted. The tags for adding\nexpansions are original (presumably self-explanatory),\nall-expansions, which refers to adding a single string containing all\nthe possible expansions (the default, just like the editor function\nexpand-word), and expansions, which refers to the results added one\nby one. By changing the order in which the tags are tried, as described\nfor the tag-order style above, you can decide how this happens. For\nexample,\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _expand _complete\n  zstyle ':completion::expand:*' tag-order expansions\nsets up for performing glob expansion via completion, with the\nexpansions being presented one by one (usually via menu completion,\nsince there is no common prefix). Altering expansions to\nall-expansions would insert the list, as done by the normal expansion\nmechanism, while altering it to `expansions original\\' would keep the\none-at-a-time entry but also present the original string as a\npossibility. You can even have all three, i.e. the entire list as a\nsingle string becomes just one of the set of possibilities.\nThere is also a sort style, which determines whether the expansions\ngenerated will be sorted in the way completions usually are, or left\njust as the shell produced them from the expansion (for example,\nexpansion of an array parameter would produce the elements in order). If\nit is true, they will always be sorted, if false or unset never, and\nif it is menu they will be sorted for the expansions tag, but not\nfor the all-expansions tag which will be a single string of the values\nin the original order.\nThere is a slight problem when you try just to generate glob\nexpansions, without substitute. In fact, it doesn\\'t take much thought\nto see that an expression like `$PWD/*.c\\' doesn\\'t mean anything if\nsubstitute is inactive; it must be active to make sense of such\nexpressions. However, this is annoying if there are no matches: you end\nup being offered a completion with the expanded $PWD, but `*.c\\'\nstill tacked on the end, which isn\\'t what you want. If you use\n_expand mainly for globbing, you might therefore want to set the style\nsubst-globs-only to true: if a completion just expands the parameters,\nand globbing does nothing, then the expansion is rejected and the line\nleft untouched.\nThe _expand completer will also use the styles\naccept-exact\n:   applies to words beginning with a `$\\' or `~\\'. Suppose there\n    is a parameter `$foo\\' and a parameter `$foobar\\' and you have\n    `$foo\\' on the line. Normally the completion system will perform\n    completion at this point. However, with accept-exact set,\n    `$foo\\' will be expanded since it matches a parameter.\nadd-space\n:   means add a space after the expansion, as with a successful\n    completion --- although directories are given a `/\\' instead.\n    For finer control, it can be set to the word file, which means the\n    space is only added if the expanded word matches a file that already\n    exists (the idea being that, if it doesn\\'t, you may want to\n    complete further). Both true and file may be combined with\n    subst, which prevents the adding of a space after expanding a\n    substitution of the form `${...}\\' or `$(...)\\'.\nkeep_prefix\n:   also addresses the question of whether a `~\\' or `$\\' should\n    be expanded. If set, the prefix will be retained, so expanding\n    `~/f*\\' to `~/foo\\' doesn\\'t turn the `~\\' into\n    `/home/pws\\'. The default is the value `changed\\', which is a\n    half-way house been false and true: it means that if there was\n    no other change in the word, i.e. no other possible expansion was\n    found, the `~\\' or `$\\' will be expanded. If the effect of\n    this style is that the expansion is the same as the unexpanded word,\n    the next completer in the list after _expand will be tried.\nsuffix\n:   is similar to keep_prefix. The `suffix\\' referred to is something\n    after an expression beginning `~\\' or `$\\' that wouldn\\'t be\n    part of that expansion. If this style is set, and such a suffix\n    exists, the expansion is not performed. So, for example,\n    `~pw\\' can be expanded to `~pws\\', but `~pw/\\' is not\n    eligible for expansion; likewise `$fo\\' and `$fo/\\'. This\n    style defaults to true --- so if you want _expand always to\n    expand such expressions, you will need to set it to false\n    yourself.\nAn easier way of getting the sort of control over expansion which the\n_expand completer provides is with the _expand_word function,\nusually bound to \\C-xe, which does all the things described above\nwithout getting mixed up with the other completers. In this case the\ncontext string starts `:completion:expand-word\\', so you can have\ndifferent styles for this than for the _expand completer.\nSetting different priorities for expansion is one good use for completer\nlabels, for example\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _expand:-glob _expand:-subst\n  zstyle ':completion:*:expand-glob:*' glob yes\n  zstyle ':completion:*:expand-subst:*' substitute yes\nis the basic set up to make _expand try glob completions and failing\nthat do substitutions, presenting the results as an expansion. You would\nalmost certainly want to add details to help this along.\n_history\\\nThis completes words from the shell\\'s history, in other words\neverything you typed or had completed or expanded on previous lines.\nThere are three styles that affect it, sort and remove-all-dups;\nthey are described for the command widget _history_complete_word\nbelow. That widget essentially performs the work of this completer as a\nspecial keystroke.\n_prefix\\\nStrictly, this completer doesn\\'t do completion itself, and should hence\nbe in the group below starting with _match. However, it seems to do\ncompletion... Let me explain.\nMany shells including zsh have the facility to complete only the word\nbefore the cursor, which zsh completion jargon refers to as the\n`prefix\\'. I explained this above when I talked about\nexpand-or-complete-prefix; when you use that instead of the normal\ncompletion functions, the word as it\\'s finally completed looks like\n`\\' where the completion has changed\n`\\' to `\\', ignoring \nthroughout.\nThe _prefix completer lets you do this as part of normal completion.\nWhat happens is that the completers are evaluated as normal, from left\nto right, until a completion is found. If _prefix is reached,\ncompletion is then attempted just on the prefix. So if your completers\nare `_complete _prefix\\', the shell will first try completion on the\nwhole word, prefix and suffix, then just on the prefix. Only the first\n`real\\' completer (_complete, _approximate, _correct, _expand,\n_history) is used.\nYou can try prefix completion more than once simply by including\n_prefix more than once in the list of completers; the second time, it\nwill try the second `real\\' completer in the list; so if they are\n`_complete _prefix _correct _prefix\\', you will get first ordinary\ncompletion, then the same for the prefix only, then ordinary correction,\nthen the same for the prefix only. You can move either of the _prefix\ncompleters to the point in the sequence where you want the prefix-only\nversion to be tried.\nThe _prefix completer will re-look up the completer style. This\nmeans that you can use a non-default set of completers for use just with\n_prefix. Here, as described in the manual, is how to force _prefix\nonly to be used as a last resort, and only with normal completion:\n  zstyle ':completion:::::' completer _complete \\ \n     _prefix\n  zstyle ':completion::prefix:::' completer _complete\nThe full contexts are shown, just to emphasise the form; as always, you\ncan use wildcards if you don\\'t care. In a case like this, you can use\nonly _prefix as the completer, and completion including the suffix\nwould never be tried; you then have to make sure you have the\ncompleter style for the prefix context, however, or no completion at\nall will be done.\nThe completer labelling trick is again useful here: you can call\n_prefix more than once, wherever you choose in your list of\ncompleters, and force it to look up in a different context each time.\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _prefix:-complete \\ \n    _approximate _prefix:-approximate\n  zstyle ':completion:*:prefix-complete:*' completer _complete\n  zstyle ':completion:*:prefix-approximate:*' completer _approximate\nThis tries ordinary completion, then the same for the prefix only, then\napproximation, then the same for the prefix only. As mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph, it is perfectly legitimate to leave out the raw\n_complete and _approximate completers and just use the forms with\nthe _prefix prefix.\nOne gotcha with the _prefix completer: you have to make sure the\noption COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set. That may sound counter-intuitive:\nafter all, _prefix forces completion not to complete inside a word.\nThe point is that without that option, completion is only ever tried at\nthe end of the word, so when you type  in the middle of\n, the cursor is moved to after the end of the suffix\nbefore the completion system has a chance to see what\\'s there, and\nhence the whole thing is regarded as a prefix, with no suffix.\nThere\\'s one more style used with _prefix: `add-space\\'. This makes\n_prefix add a real, live space when it completes the prefix, instead\nof just pretending there was one there, hence separating the completed\nword from the original suffix; otherwise it would simply leave the\nresulting word all joined together, as expand-or-complete-prefix\nusually does.\n_ignored\\\nLike _prefix this is a bit of a hybrid, mopping up after completions\nwhich have already been generated. It allows you to have completions\nwhich have already been rejected by the style `ignored-patterns\\'.\nI\\'ll describe that below, but it\\'s effect is very simple: for the\ncontext given, the list of patterns you specify are matched against\npossible completions, and any that match are removed from the list. The\n_ignored completer allows you to retrieve those removed completions\nlater in your completer list, in case nothing else matched.\nThis is used by the $fignore mechanism --- a list of suffixes of\nfiles not normally to be completed --- which is actually built on top\nof ignored-patterns, so if you use that in the way familiar to current\nzsh users, where the ignored matches are shown if there are no unignored\nmatches, you need the _ignored completer in your completer list.\nOne slightly annoying feature with _ignored is if there is only a\nsingle possible completion, since it will then be unconditionally\ninserted. Hardly a surprise, but it can be annoying if you really don\\'t\nwant that choice. There is a style single-ignored which you can set to\nshow --- just show the single ignored match, don\\'t insert it ---\nor to menu --- go to menu completion so that TAB cycles you between\nthe completion which _ignored produced and what you originally typed.\nThe latter gives a very natural way of handling ignored files; it\\'s\nsort of saying `well, I found this but you might not like it, so hit\ntab again if you want to go back to what you had before\\'.\nI said this was like _prefix, and indeed you can specify which\ncompleters are called for the _ignored completer in just the same way,\nby giving the completer style in the context\n`:completion:*:ignored:*\\'. That means my description has been a\nlittle over-simplified: _ignored doesn\\'t really use the completions\nwhich were ignored before; rather, when it\\'s called it generates a list\nof possibilities where the choices matched by ignore-patterns --- or\ninternally using $fignore --- are not ignored. So it should really\nbe called `_not_ignored\\', but it isn\\'t.\n_match\\\nThis and the remaining completers are utilities, which affect the main\ncompleters given above when put into the completion list rather than\ndoing completion themselves.\nThe _match completer should appear after _complete; it is a more\nflexible form of the GLOB_COMPLETE option. In other words, if\n_complete didn\\'t succeed, it will try to match the word on the line\nas a pattern, not just a fixed string, against the possible completions.\nTo make it work like normal completion, it usually acts as if a `*\\'\nwas inserted at the cursor position, even if the word already contains\nwildcards.\nYou can control the addition of `*\\' with the `match-original\\'\nstyle; the normal behaviour occurs if this is unset. If it is set to\n`only\\', the `*\\' is not inserted, and if it is `true\\', or\nactually any other string, it will try first without the `*\\', then\nwith. For example, consider typing `setopt c*ect\\' with the\n_match completer in use. Normally this will produce two possibilities,\n`correct\\' and `correctall\\'. After setting the style,\n  zstyle ':completion::match:*' original only\nno `*\\' would be inserted at the place where you hit `TAB\\', so\nthat `correct\\' is the only possible match.\nThe _match completer uses the style insert-unambiguous in just the\nsame way as does _approximate.\n_all_matches\\\nThis has a similar effect to performing expansion instead of completion:\nall the possible completions are inserted onto the command line.\nHowever, it uses the results of ordinary contextual completion to\nachieve this. The normal way that the completion system achieves this is\nby influencing the behaviour of any subsequent completers which are\ncalled --- hence you will need to put _all_matches in the list of\ncompleters before any which you would like to have this behaviour.\nYou\\'re unlikely to want to do this with every type of completion, so\nthere are two ways of limiting its effect. First, there is the\navoid-completer style: you can set this to a list of completers which\nshould not insert all matches, and they will be handled normally.\nThen there is the style old-matches. This forces _all_matches to use\nan existing list of matches, if it exists, rather than what would be\ngenerated this time round. You can set the style to only instead of\ntrue; in this case _all_matches will never apply to the completions\nwhich would be generated this time round, it will only use whatever list\nof completions already exists.\nThis can be a nuisance if applied to normal completion generation ---\nthe usual list would never be generated, since _all_matches would just\ninsert the non-existent list from last time --- so the manual\nrecommends two other ways of using the completer with this style. First,\nyou can add a condition to the use of the style:\n  zstyle -e ':completion:*' old-matches 'reply=(${NUMERIC:-false})'\nThis returns false unless there is a non-zero numeric argument; if you\ntype 1 in emacs mode, or just 1 in vi mode, before completion,\nit will insert all the values generated by the immediately preceding\ncompletion.\nOtherwise, you can bind _all_matches separately. This is probably the\nmore useful; copying the manual entry:\n  zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic\n  bindkey '^Xa' all-matches\n  zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' completer _all_matches\n  zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' old-matches only\nHere we generate ourselves a new completion based on the complete-word\nwidget, called all-matches --- this name is arbitrary but\nconvenient. We bind that to the keystroke ^Xa, and give it two special\nstyles which normal completion won\\'t see. For the completer we set\njust _all_matches, and for old-matches we set only; the effect is\nthat ^Xa will only ever have the effect of inserting all the\ncompletions which were generated by the last completion, whatever that\nwas --- it does not have to be an ordinary contextual completion, it\nmay be the result of any completion widget.\n_list\\\nIf you have this in the list of completers (at the beginning is as good\nas anything), then the first time you try completion, you only get a\nlist; nothing changes, not even a common prefix is inserted. The second\ntime, completion continues as normal. This is like typing ^D, then\ntab, but using just the one key. This differs from the usual AUTO_LIST\nbehaviour in that is entirely irrespective of whether the completion is\nambiguous; you always get the list the first time, and it always does\ncompletion in the usual way the second time.\nThe _list completer also uses the condition style, which works a bit\nlike the styles for the _expand completer: it must be set to one of\nthe values corresponding to `true\\' for the _list delaying behaviour\nto take effect. You can test for a particular value of $NUMERIC or any\nother condition by using the -e option of zstyle when defining the\nstyle.\nFinally, the boolean style word is also relevant. If false or unset,\n_list examines the whole line when deciding if it has changed, and\nhence completion should be delayed until the next keypress. If true, it\njust examines the current word. Note that _list has no knowledge of\nwhat happens between those completion calls; looking at the command line\nis its only resource.\n_menu\\\nThis just implements menu completion in shell code; it should come\nbefore the `real\\' completion generators in the completers style. It\nignores the MENU_COMPLETION option and other related options and the\nnormal menu-completion widgets don\\'t work well with it. However, you\ncan copy it and write your own completers.\n_oldlist\\\nThis completer is most useful when you are in the habit of using special\ncompletion functions, i.e. commands other than the standard completion\nsystem. It is able to hang onto an old completion list which would\notherwise be replaced with a newly generated one. There are two aspects\nto this.\nFirst, listing. Suppose you try to complete something from the shell\nhistory, using the command bound to `ESC-/\\'. For example, I typed\n`echo ma\\' and got `max-errors\\'. At this point you might\nwant to list the possible completions. Unfortunately, if you type ^D,\nit will simply list all the usual contextual completions --- for the\necho command, which is not handled specially, these are simply files.\nSo it doesn\\'t work. By putting the _oldlist completer into the\ncompleters style before _complete, it does work, because the old\nlist of matches is kept for ^D to use.\nIn this case, you can force old-listing on or off by setting the\nold-list style to always or never; usually it shows the listing\nfor the current set of completions if that isn\\'t already displayed, and\notherwise generates the standard listing. You can even set the value of\nold-list to a list of completers which will always have their list\nkept in this way.\nThe other place where _oldlist is useful is in menu completion, where\nexactly the same problem occurs: if you generate a menu from a special\ncommand, then try to cycle through by hitting tab, completion will look\nfor normal contextual matches instead. There\\'s a way round this time\n--- use the special command key repeatedly instead of tab. This is\nrather tedious with multiple key sequences. Again, _oldlist cures\nthis, and again you can control the behaviour with a style, old-menu,\nwhich takes a boolean value (it is on by default). As Orwell put it,\noldlisters unbellyfeel menucomp.\nOrdering completers\\\nI\\'ve given various suggestions about the order in which completers\nshould come in, which might be confusing. Here, therefore, is a\nsuggested order; just miss out any completers you don\\'t want to use:\n  _all_matches _list _oldlist _menu _expand _complete _match\n    _ignored _correct _approximate _prefix \nOther orders are certainly possible and maybe even useful: for example,\nthe _all_matches completer applies to all the completers following not\nlisted in the avoid-completer style, so you might have good reason to\nshift it further down the list.\nHere\\'s my example of labels for completers, which I mentioned just\nabove the list of different completers, whereby completers can be looked\nup under different names.\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _approximate:-one \\ \n    _complete:-extended _approximate:-four\n  zstyle ':completion:*:approximate-one:*' max-errors 1\n  zstyle ':completion:*:complete-extended:*' \\ \n    matcher 'r:|[.,_-]=* r:|=*'\n  zstyle ':completion:*:approximate-four:*' max-errors 4\nThis tries the following in order.\n\nOrdinary, no-frills completion.\nApproximation with one error, as given by the second style.\nOrdinary completion with extended completion turned on, as given by\nthe third style. Sorry, this will be a black box until I talk about\nthe matcher style later on; for now, you\\'ll just have to take my\nword for it that this style allows the characters in the square\nbrackets to have a wildcard in front, so `a-b\\' can complete to\n`able-baker\\', and so on.\nApproximation with up to four errors, as given by the final style.\n\nHere\\'s a rather bogus example. You have a directory containing:\n  foobar  fortified-badger  frightfully-barbaric\nActually, it\\'s not bogus at all, since I just created one. First try\n`echo foo\\'; no surprise, you get `foobar\\'. Now try\ncompleting with `fo-b\\' after the `echo\\': basic completion\nfails, it gets to `_approximate:-one\\' and finds that it\\'s allowed\none error, so accepts the completion `foobar\\' again. Now try\n`fort-ba\\'. This time nothing kicks in until the third\ncompletion, which effectively allows it to match `fort*-ba*\\',\nso you see `fortified-badger\\' (no, I\\'ve never seen one myself, but\nthey\\'re nocturnal, you know). Finally, try `fortfully-ba\\'; the\nlast entry, which allows up to four errors, thoughtfully corrects\n`or\\' to `righ\\', and you get `frightfully-barbaric\\'. All\nright, the example is somewhat unhinged, but I think you can see the\nfeatures are useful. If it makes you feel better, it took me four or\nfive attempts to get the styles right for this.\n[]{#l158}\n6.5.2: Changing the format of listings: groups etc.\nformat\\\nYou can use this style if you want to find out where the completions in\na completion listing come from. The most basic use is to set it for the\ndescriptions tag in any completion context. It takes a string value in\nwhich `%d\\' should appear; this will be replaced by a description of\nwhatever is being completed. For example, I use:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format 'Completing %d'\nand if I type cd^D, I see a listing like this (until I define the\ngroup-name style, that is):\n  Completing external command\n  Completing builtin command\n  Completing shell function\n  cd                cddbsubmit        cdp               cdrecord\n  cdctrl            cdecl             cdparanoia        cdswap\n  cdda2wav          cdmatch           cdparanoia-yaf\n  cddaslave         cdmatch.newer     cdplay\n  cddbslave         cdot              cdplayer_applet\nThe descriptions at the top are related to the tag names --- usually\nthere\\'s a unique correspondence --- but are in a more readable form;\nto get the tag names, you need to use ^Xh. You will no doubt see\nsomething different, but the point is that the completions listed are a\nmixture of external commands (e.g. cdplay), builtin commands (cd)\nand shell functions (cdmatch, which happens to be a leftover from\nold-style completion, showing you how often I clean out my function\ndirectory), and it\\'s often quite handy to know what you have.\nYou can use some prompt escapes in the description, specifically those\nthat turn on or off standout mode (`%S\\', `%s\\'), bold text\n(`%B\\', `%b\\'), and underlined text (`%U\\', `%u\\'), to make\nthe descriptions stand out from the completion lists.\nYou can set this for some other tag than descriptions and the format\nthus defined will be used only for completions of that tag.\ngroup-name, group-order\\\nIn the format example just above, you may have wondered if it is\npossible to make the different types of completion appear separately,\ntogether with the description. You can do this using groups. They are\nalso related to tags, although as you can define group names via the\ngroup-name style it is possible to give different names for completion\nin any context. However, to start off with it is easiest to give the\nvalue of the style an empty string, which means that group names are\njust the names of the tags. In other words,\n  zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''\nassigns a different group name for each tag. Later, you can fine-tune\nthis with more specific patterns, if you decide you want various tags to\nhave the same group name. If no group name is defined, the group used is\ncalled `-default-\\', so this is what was happening before you issued\nthe zstyle command above; all matches were in that group.\nThe reason for groups is this: matches in the same group are shown\ntogether, matches in different groups are shown separately. So the\ncompletion list from the previous example, with both the format and\ngroup-name styles set, becomes:\n  Completing external command\n  cdctrl            cddbsubmit        cdparanoia        cdrecord\n  cdda2wav          cdecl             cdparanoia-yaf\n  cddaslave         cdot              cdplay\n  cddbslave         cdp               cdplayer_applet\n  Completing builtin command\n  cd\n  Completing shell function\n  cdmatch                 cdmatch.newer           cdswap\nwhich you may find more helpful, or you may find messier, depending on\ndeep psychological factors outside my control.\nIf (and only if) you are using group-name, you can also use\ngroup-order. As its name suggests, it determines the order in which\nthe different completion groups are displayed. It\\'s a little like\ntag-order, which I described when tags were first introduced: the\nvalue is just a set of names of groups, in the order you want to see\nthem. The example from the manual is relevant to the listing I just\nshowed:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:-command-' group-order \\ \n      builtins functions commands\n--- remember that the `-command-\\' context is used when the names\nof commands, rather than their arguments, are being completed. Not\nsurprisingly, that listing now becomes:\n  Completing builtin command\n  cd\n  Completing shell function\n  cdmatch                 cdmatch.newer           cdswap\n  Completing external command\n  cdctrl            cddbsubmit        cdparanoia        cdrecord\n  cdda2wav          cdecl             cdparanoia-yaf\n  cddaslave         cdot              cdplay\n  cddbslave         cdp               cdplayer_applet\nand if you investigate the tags available by using ^Xh, you\\'ll see\nthat there are others such as aliases whose order we haven\\'t defined.\nThese appear after the ones for which you have defined the order and in\nsome order decided by the function which generated the matches.\ntag-order\\\nAs I already said, I\\'ve already described this, but it\\'s here again\nfor completeness.\nverbose, auto-description\\\nThese are relatives of format as they add helpful messages to the\nlisting. If verbose is true, the function generating the matches may,\nat its discretion, decide to show more information about them. The most\ncommon case is when describing options; the standard function\n_describe that handles descriptions for a whole lot of options tests\nthe verbose style and will print information about the options it is\ncompleting.\nYou can also set the string style auto-description; it too is useful\nfor options, in the case that they don\\'t have a special description,\nbut they do have a single following argument, which completion already\nknows about. Then the description of the argument for verbose printing\nwill be available as `%d\\' in auto-describe, so that something like\nthe manual recommendation `specify: %d\\' will document the option\nitself. So if a command takes `-o \\' and the argument\nhas the description `output file\\', the `-o\\', when it appears as\na possible completion, will have the description\n`specify: output file\\' if it does not have its own description. In\nfact, most options recognized by the standard completion functions\nalready have their own descriptions supplied, and this is more subtlety\nthan most people will probably need.\nlist-colors\\\nThis is used to display lists of matches for files in different colours\ndepending on the file type. It is based on the syntax of the\n$LS_COLORS environment variable, used by the GNU version of ls. You\nwill need a terminal which is capable of displaying colour such as a\ncolour xterm, and should make sure the zsh/complist library is loaded,\n(it should be automatically if you are using menu selection set up with\nthe menu style, or if you use this style). But you can make sure\nexplicitly:\n  zmodload -i zsh/complist\nThe -i keeps it quiet if the module was already loaded. To install a\nstandard set of default colours, you can use:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors ''\n--- note the use of the `default\\' tag --- since a null string\nsets the value to the default.\nIf that\\'s not good enough for you, here are some more detailed\ninstructions. The parameter $ZLS_COLORS is the lowest-level part of\nthe system used by zsh/complist. There is a simple builtin default,\nwhile having the style set to the empty string is equivalent to:\n  ZLS_COLORS=\"no=00:fi=00:di=01;34:ln=01;36:\\ \n  pi=40;33:so=01;35:bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:\\ \n  ex=01;32:lc=\\e[:rm=m:tc=00:sp=00:ma=07:hi=00:du=00\nIt has essentially the same format as $LS_COLORS, and indeed you can\nget a more useful set of values by using the dircolors command which\ncomes with ls:\n  ZLS_COLORS=\"no=00:fi=00:di=01;34:ln=01;36:\\ \n  pi=40;33:so=01;35:do=01;35:bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:\\ \n  or=40;31;01:ex=01;32:*.tar=01;31:*.tgz=01;31:\\ \n  *.arj=01;31:*.taz=01;31:*.lzh=01;31:*.zip=01;31:\\ \n  *.z=01;31:*.Z=01;31:*.gz=01;31:*.deb=01;31:\\ \n  *.jpg=01;35:*.gif=01;35:*.bmp=01;35:*.ppm=01;35:\\ \n  *.tga=01;35:*.xbm=01;35:*.xpm=01;35:*.tif=01;35:\\ \n  *.mpg=01;37:*.avi=01;37:*.gl=01;37:*.dl=01;37:\"\nYou should see the manual for the zsh/complist module for details, but\nnote in particular the addition of the type `ma\\', which specifies\nhow the current match in menu selection is displayed. The default for\nthat is to use standout mode --- the same effect as the sequence %S\nin a prompt, which you can display with `print -P %Sfoo\\'.\nHowever, you need to define the style directly, since the completion\nalways uses that to set $ZLS_COLORS; otherwise it doesn\\'t know\nwhether the value it has found has come from the user or is a previous\nvalue taken from some style. That takes this format:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors \"no=00\" \"fi=00\" ...\nYou can use an already defined $LS_COLORS:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}\n(which splits the parameter to an array on colons) as $LS_COLORS is\nstill useful for ls, even though it\\'s not worth setting $ZLS_COLORS\ndirectly. This should mean GNU ls and zsh produce similar-looking lists.\nThere are some special effects allowed. You can use patterns to tell how\nfilenames are matched: that\\'s part of the default behaviour, in fact,\nfor example \\'*.tar=01;31\\' forces tar files to be coloured red. In\nthat case, you are limited to `*\\' followed by a string. However,\nthere\\'s a way of specifying colouring for any match, not just files,\nand for any pattern: use ==. Here are two ways of getting\njobs coloured red in process listings for the `kill\\' command.\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*' list-colors '=%*=01;31'\nThis uses the method just described; jobs begin with `%\\'.\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:jobs' list-colors 'no=01;31'\nThis uses the tag, rather than the pattern, to match the jobs lines. It\nhas various advantages. Because you are using the tag, it\\'s much easier\nto alter this for all commands using jobs, not just kill --- just miss\nout `kill\\' from the string. That wasn\\'t practical with the other\nmethod because it would have matched too many other things you didn\\'t\nwant. You\\'re not dependent on using a particular pattern, either. And\nfinally, if you try it with a `format\\' description you\\'ll see that\nthat gets the colour, too, since it matched the correct tag. Note the\nuse of the `no\\' to specify that this is to apply for a normal match;\nthe other two-letter codes for file types aren\\'t useful here.\nHowever, there is one even more special effect you can use with the\ngeneral pattern form. By turning on `backreferences\\' with `(#b)\\'\ninside the pattern, parentheses are active and the bits they match can\nbe coloured separately. You do this by extending the list of colours,\neach code preceded by an `=\\' sign, and the extra elements will be\nused to colour what the parenthesis matched. Here\\'s another example for\n`kill\\', which turns the process number red, but leaves the rest\nalone.\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:processes' list-colors \\ \n    '=(#b) #([0-9]#)*=0=01;31'\nThe hieroglyphics are extended globbing patterns. You should note that\nthe EXTENDED_GLOB option is always on inside styles --- it\\'s\nrequired for the `#b\\' to take effect. In particular, `#\\' means\n`zero or more repetitions of the previous bit of the pattern\\' with\nextended glob patterns; see the globbing manual page for full details.\nignored-patterns\\\nMany shells, including zsh, have a parameter $fignore, which gives a\nlist of suffixes; filenames ending in any of these are not to be used in\ncompletion. A typical value is:\n  fignore=(.o \\~ .dvi)\nso that normal file completion will not produce object files, EMACS\nbackup files, or TeX DVI files.\nThe ignored-patterns style is an extension of this. It takes an array\nvalue, like fignore, but with various differences. Firstly, these\nvalues are patterns which should match the whole value to be\ncompleted, including prefixes (such as the directory part of a filename)\nas well as suffixes. Secondly, they apply to all completions, not just\nfiles, since you can use the style mechanism to tune it to apply\nwherever you want, down to particular tags.\nHence you can replace the use of $fignore above with the following:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:files' ignored-patterns '*?.o' '*?~' '*?.dvi'\nfor completion contexts where the tag `files\\' is in use. The extra\n`?\\'s are because $fignore was careful only to apply to real\nsuffixes, i.e. strings which had something in front of them, and the\n`?\\' forces there to be at least one character present.\nActually, this isn\\'t quite the same as $fignore, since there are\nother file tags than files; apart from those for directories, which\nyou\\'ve already met, there are globbed-files and all-files. The\nformer is for cases where a pattern is specified by the completion\nfunction, for example `*.dvi\\' for files following the command name\ndvips. These don\\'t use this style, because the pattern was already\nsufficiently specified. This follows the behaviour for $fignore in the\nold completion system. Another slight difference, as I said above when\ndiscussing the _ignored completer, is that you get to choose whether\nyou want to see those ignored files if the normal completions fail, by\nhaving _ignored in the completer list or not.\nThe other tag, all-files, applies when a globbed-files tag failed,\nand says any old file is good enough in that case; you can arrange how\nthis happens with the tag-order style. In this example,\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:dvips:argument*' \\ \n    tag-order globbed-files all-files\nis enough to say that you want to see all files if no files were\nproduced from the pattern, i.e. if there were no `*.dvi\\' files in\nthe directory. Finally the point of this ramble: as the all-files tag\nis separate from the files tag, in this case you really would see all\nfiles (except for those beginning with a `.\\', as usual). You might\nfind this useful, but you can easily make the all-files tag behave the\nsame way as files:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:(all-|)files' ignored-patterns ...\nHere\\'s the example of using tag labels I promised earlier; it\\'s simply\ntaken from the manual. To refresh your memory: tag labels are a way of\nsaying that tags should be looked up under a different name. Here we\\'ll\ndo:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*' tag-order 'functions:-non-comp'\nThis applies in command position, from the special `-command-\\'\ncontext, the place where functions occur most often, along with other\ntypes of command which have their own tags. This says that when\nfunctions are first looked up, they are to be looked up with the name\n`functions-non-comp\\' --- remember that with a hyphen as the first\ncharacter of the label part, the bit after the colon, the functions\ntag name itself, the bit before the colon, is to be stuck in front to\ngive the full label name `functions-non-comp\\'. We can use it as\nfollows:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:functions-non-comp' ignored-patterns '_*'\nIn the context of this tag label, we have told completion to ignore any\npatterns --- i.e. any function names --- beginning with an\nunderscore. What happens is this: when we try completion in command\nposition, tag-order is looked up and finds we want to try functions\nfirst, but under the name functions-non-comp; this completes functions\napart from ones beginning with an underscore (presumably completion\nfunctions you don\\'t want to run interactively). Since tag-order\nnormally tries all the other tags, unless it was told not to, in this\ncase all the normal command completions will appear, including functions\nunder their normal tag name, so this just acts as a sort of filter for\nthe first attempt at completion. This is typically what tag labels are\nintended for --- though maybe you can think up a lot of other uses,\nsince the idea is quite powerful, being backed up by the style\nmechanism.\nYou way wonder why you would want to ignore such functions at this\npoint. After all, you\\'re only likely to be doing completion when\nyou\\'ve already typed the first character, which either is `_\\' or it\nisn\\'t. It becomes useful with correction and approximation ---\nparticularly since many completion functions are similar to the names of\nthe commands for which they handle completion. You don\\'t want to be\noffered `_zmodload\\' as a completion if you really want\n`zmodload\\'. The combination of labels and ignored patterns does this\nfor you.\nYou can generalise this using another feature: tags can actually be\npatterns, which I mentioned but didn\\'t demonstrate. Here\\'s a more\nsophisticated version of the previous example, adapted from the manual:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*' tag-order \\ \n  'functions:-non-comp:non-completion\\ functions *' functions\nIt\\'s enhanced so that completion tries all other possible tags at the\nsame time as the labelled functions. However, it only ever tries a tag\nonce at each step, so the `*\\' doesn\\'t put back functions as you\nmight expect --- that\\'s still tried under the label\n`functions-non-comp\\', and the ignored-patterns style we set will\nstill work. In the final word, we try all possible functions, so that\nthose beginning with an underscore will be restored.\nUse of the `_ignored\\' completer can allow you to play tricks without\nhaving to label your tags:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _ignored\n  zstyle ':completion:*:functions' ignored-patterns '_*'\nNow anywhere the functions tag is valid, functions matching `_*\\'\naren\\'t shown until completion reaches the `_ignored\\' in the\ncompleter list. Of course, you should manipulate the completer list the\nway you want; this just shows the bare bones.\nprefix-hidden, prefix-needed\\\nYou will know that when the shell lists matches for files, the directory\npart is removed. The boolean style prefix-hidden extends this idea to\nvarious other types of matches. The prefixes referred to are not just\nany old common prefix to matches, but only some places defined in the\ncompletion system: the - prefix to options, the `%\\' prefix to\njobs, the - or + prefix to directory stack entries are the most\ncommonly used.\nThe prefix-needed applies not to listings, but instead to what the\nuser types on the command line. It says that matches will only be\ngenerated if the user has typed the prefix common to them. It applies on\nbroadly the same occasions as prefix-hidden.\nlist-packed, list-rows-first, accept-exact, last-prompt,\nmenu\\\nThe first two of these have already been introduced, and correspond to\nthe LIST_PACKED and LIST_ROWS_FIRST options. The accept-exact and\nlast-prompt styles correspond essentially to the REC_EXACT and\nALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT options in the same way.\nThe style menu roughly corresponds to the MENU_COMPLETE option, but\nthere is also the business of deciding whether to use menu selection, as\ndescribed above. These two uses don\\'t interfere with each other ---\nexcept that, as I explained, menu completion must be started to use menu\nselection --- so a value like `true select=6\\' is valid; it turns\non menu completion for the context, and also activates menu selection if\nthere are at least 6 choices.\nThere are some other, slightly more obscure, choices for menu:\nyes=num\n:   turn on menu completion only if there are at least num matches;\nno=num\n:   turn off menu completion if there are as many as num matches;\nyes=long\n:   turn on menu completion if the list does not fit on the screen, and\n    completion was attempted;\nyes=long-list\n:   the same, but do it even if listing, not completion, was attempted;\nselect=long\n:   like yes=long, but this time turn on menu selection, too;\nselect=long-list\n:   like yes=long-list, but turn on menu selection, too.\nIn case your eyes glazed over before the end, here\\'s a full description\nof the last one, select=long-list, which is quite useful: if you are\nattempting completion or even just listing completions, and the list of\nmatches would be too long to fit on the screen, then menu selection is\nturned on, so that you can use the cursor keys (and other selection\nkeys) to move up and down the list. Generally, the above possibilities\ncan be combined, unless the combined effect wouldn\\'t work.\nAs always, yes and true are equivalent, as are no and false. It\njust hurts the eyes of programmers to read something which appears to\nassign a value to true.\nhidden\\\nThis is a little obscure for most users. Its context should be\nrestricted to specific tags; any corresponding matches will not be shown\nin completion listings, but will be available for inserting into the\ncommand line. If its value is `true\\', then the description for the\ntag may still appear; if the value is `all\\', even that is\nsuppressed. If you don\\'t want the completions even to be available for\ninsertion, use the tag-order style.\n[]{#l159}\n6.5.3: Styles affecting particular completions\nThe styles listed here are for use only with certain completions as\nnoted. I have not included the styles used by particular completers,\nwhich are described with the completer in question in the subsection\n`Specifying completers and their options\\'. I have also not\ndescribed styles used only in separate widgets that do completion; the\nrelevant information is all together in the next section.\nFilenames (1): patterns: file-patterns\\\nIt was explained above for the tag-order style that when a function\nuses pattern matching to generate file completions, such as all *.ps\nfiles or all *.gz files, the three tags globbed-files, directories\nand all-files are tried, in that order.\nThe file-patterns style allows you to specify a pattern to override\nwhatever would be completed, even in what would otherwise be a simple\nfile completion with no pattern. Since this can easily get out of hand,\nthe best way of using this style is to make sure that you specify it for\na narrowly enough defined context. In particular, you probably want to\nrestrict it to completions for a single command and for a particular one\nof the tags usually applying to files. As always, you can use ^Xh to\nfind out what the context is. It has a labelling mechanism --- you can\nspecify a tag with a pattern for use in looking up other styles. Hence\n`*.o:object-files\\' gives a pattern `*.o\\' and a tag name\n`object-files\\' by which to refer to these.\nThe patterns you specify are tried in order; you don\\'t need to use\ntag-order. In fact file-patterns replicates its behaviour in that\nyou can put patterns in the same word to say they should be tried\ntogether, before going on to the pattern(s) in the next word. Also, you\ncan give a description after a second colon in the same way. Indeed,\nsince file-patterns gets its hands on the tags first, any ordering\ndefined there can\\'t be overridden by tag-order.\nSo, for example, after\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' file-patterns \\ \n    '*.yo:yodl-files:yodl\\ files *(-/):directories'\nthe command named `foo\\' will complete files ending in `.yo\\', as\nwell as directories. For once, you don\\'t have to change the completer\nto alter what\\'s completed: `foo\\' isn\\'t specially handled, so it\ncauses default completion, and that means completing files, so that\nfile-patterns is active anyway.\nHere\\'s a slightly enhanced example; it shows how file-patterns can be\nused instead of tag-order to offer the tags in the order you want.\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' file-patterns \\ \n    '*.yo:yodl-files:yodl\\ files' '*(-/):directories:directories' \\ \n    '^*.yo(-^/):other-files:other\\ files'\nCompletion will first try to show you only `.yo\\' files, if there are\nany; otherwise it will show you directories, if there are any; otherwise\nit will show you any other files: `^*.yo(-^/)\\' is an extended glob\nto match any file which doesn\\'t end in `.yo\\' and which isn\\'t a\ndirectory and doesn\\'t link to a directory. As always, you can cycle\nthrough the sets of possibilities using the `_next_tag\\' completion\ncommand.\nNote that file-patterns is an exception to the general rule that\nstyles don\\'t determine which tags are called only where they\\'re\ncalled, or what their behaviour is: this time, you actually get to\nspecify the set of tags which will be used. This means it doesn\\'t use\nthe the standard file tags (unless you use those names yourself, of\ncourse), just `files\\' if you don\\'t specify one. Hence it\\'s good\nstyle to add the tags, following colons, although it\\'ll work without.\nAnother thing to watch out for is that if there is already a completion\nwhich handles a file type --- for example, if we had tried to alter\nthe effect of file completion for the `yodl\\' command instead of the\nfictitious `foo\\' --- the results may well not be quite what you\nwant.\nAnother feature is that `%p\\' in the pattern inserts the pattern\nwhich would usually be used. That means that the following is\nessentially the same as what file completion normally does:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' file-patterns '%p:globbed-files' \\ \n    '*(-/):directories' '*:all-files'\nYou can turn completion for a command that usually doesn\\'t use a\npattern into one that does. Another example taken from the manual:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:rm:*:globbed-files' file-patterns \\ \n    '*.o:object-files' '%p:all-files'\nSo if there are any *.o files around, completion for rm will just\ncomplete those, even if arguments to rm are otherwise found by default\nfile completion (which they usually are). The %p will use whatever\nfile completion normally would have; probably any file at all. You can\nchange this, if you like; there may be files you don\\'t ever want\nautomatically completed after rm.\nRemember that using explicit patterns overrides the effect of\n$fignore; this is obviously useful with rm, since the files you want\nto delete are often those you usually don\\'t want to complete.\nFilenames (2): paths: ambiguous, expand, file-sort,\nspecial-dirs, ignore-parents, list-suffixes, squeeze-slashes\\\nFilename completion is powerful enough to complete all parts of a path\nat once, for example `/h/p/z\\' will complete to `/home/pws/zsh\\'.\nThis can cause problems when the match is ambiguous; since several\ncomponents of the path may well be ambiguous, how much should the\ncompletion system complete, and where should it leave the cursor? This\nfacility is associated with all these styles affecting filenames.\nWith ordinary completion, the usual answer is that the completion is\nhalted as soon as a path component matches more than one possibility,\nand the cursor is moved to that point, with the remainder of the string\nleft unaltered. With menu completion, you can simply cycle through the\npossibilities with the cursor moved to the end as usual. If you set the\nstyle ambiguous, then the system will leave the cursor at the point of\nthe first ambiguity even if menu completion is in use. Note that this is\nalways used with the `paths\\' tag, i.e. the context ends in\n`...:paths\\'.\nThe style expand is similar and is also applied with the `paths\\'\ntag. It can include either or both of the strings prefix and suffix.\nBe careful when setting both --- they have to be separate words, for\nexample\n  zstyle ':completion:*' expand prefix suffix\nDon\\'t put quotes around `prefix suffix\\' as it won\\'t work.\nWith prefix, expand tells the completion system always to expand\nunambiguous prefixes in a path (such as `/u/i\\' to `/usr/in\\',\nwhich matches both /usr/include and /usr/info) --- even if the\nremainder of the string on the command line doesn\\'t match any file. So\nthis expansion will now happen even if you try this on\n`/u/i/ALoadOfOldCodswallop\\', which it otherwise wouldn\\'t.\nIncluding suffix in the value of expand extends path completion in\nanother way: it allows extra unambiguous parts to be added even after\nthe first ambiguous one. So if `/home/p/.pr\\' would match\n`/home/pws/.procmailrc\\' or `/home/patricia/.procmailrc\\', and\nnothing else, the last word would be expanded. Set up like this, you\nwill always get the longest unambiguous match for all parts of the path.\nIn older versions of the completion system, suffix wasn\\'t used if you\nhad menu completion active by default, although it was if menu\ncompletion was only started by the AUTO_MENU option. However, in\nrecent versions, the setting is always respected. This means that\nsetting the expand style to include the value suffix allows menu\ncompletion to cycle through all possible completions, as if there were a\n`*\\' after each part of the path, so `/u/i/k\\' will offer all\nmatches for `/u*/i*/k*\\'.\nThe file-sort style allows files to be sorted in a way other than by\nalphabetical order: sorting applies both to the list of files, and to\nthe order in which menu completion presents them. The value should\ninclude one of the following: `size\\', `links\\',\n`modification\\' (same as `time\\', `date\\'), `access\\',\n`inode\\' (same as `change\\'). These pick the obvious properties\nfor sorting: file size, number of hard links, modification time, access\ntime, inode change time. You can also add the string `reverse\\' to\nthe value, which reverses the order. In this case the tag is always\n`files\\'.\nThe special-dirs style controls completion of the special directories\n`.\\' and `..\\'. Given that you usually need to type an initial dot\nto complete anything at all beginning with one, the idea of\n`completing\\' `.\\' is a little odd; it simply means that the\ndirectory is accepted when the completion is started on it. You can set\nthe style to true to allow completion to both of the two, or to\n`..\\' to complete `..\\' but not `.\\'. Like ambiguous, this is\nused with the tag set to `paths\\'.\nThe style ignore-parents is used with the files tag, since it\napplies to paths, but not necessarily completion of multiple path names\nat once; it can be used when completing just the last element. There are\ntwo main uses, which can be combined. The first case is to include the\nstring `parent\\' in the style. This means that when you complete\nafter (say) foo/../, the string foo won\\'t appear as a choice, since\nit already appeared in the string. Secondly, you can include `pwd\\'\nin the value; this means don\\'t complete the current working directory\nafter `../\\' --- you can see the sense in that: if you wanted to\ncomplete there, you wouldn\\'t have typed the `..\\' to get out if it.\nActually, the function performs both those tests on the directories in\nquestion even if the string `..\\' itself hasn\\'t been typed. That\nmight be more confusing, and you can make sure that the tests for\nparent and pwd are only made when you typed the `..\\' by\nincluding a `..\\' in the style\\'s value. Finally, you can include the\nstring `directory\\' in the values: that means the tests will only be\nperformed when directories are being completed, while if some other sort\nof file, or any file, can be completed, the special behaviour doesn\\'t\noccur. You may have to read that through a couple of times before\ndeciding if you need it or not.\nNext, there is list-suffixes. It applies when expanding out earlier\nparts of the filename path, not just the last part. In this case, it is\npossible that early parts of the path were ambiguous. Normally\ncompletion stops at the point where it finds the ambiguity, and leaves\nthe rest of the path alone. When list-suffixes is set, it will list\nall the possible values of all ambiguous components from the point of\nambiguity onward.\nLastly, there is the style squeeze-slashes. This is rather simpler.\nYou probably already know that in a UNIX filename multiple slashes are\ntreated just like a single slash (with a few minor exceptions on some\nsystems). However, path completion usually assumes that multiple slashes\nmean multiple directories to be completed: `//termc\\' completes to\n`/etc/termcap\\' because of this rule. If you want to stick with the\nordinary UNIX rule you can set squeeze-slashes to true. Then in this\nexample only files in the root directory will be completed.\nProcesses: command, insert-ids\\\nSome functions, such as kill, take process IDs (i.e. numbers) as\narguments. These can be completed by using the ps command to generate\nthe process numbers. The command style allows you to specify which\narguments are to be passed to ps to generate the numbers; it is simply\neval\\'d to generate the command line. For example, if you are root and\nwant to have all processes as possible completions, you might use\n`-e\\', for many modern systems, or `ax\\', for older BSD-like\nsystems. The completion system tries to find a column which is headed\n`PID\\' or `pid\\' (or even `Pid\\', in fact) to use for the\nprocess IDs; if it doesn\\'t find one, it just uses the first column.\nThe default is not to use any arguments; most variants of ps will then\njust show you interactive processes from your current session. To show\nall your own processes on a modern system, you can probably use the\nvalue `ps -u$USER\\' for the style --- remembering to put this in\nsingle quotes. Clearly, you need to make sure the context is narrow\nenough to avoid unexpectedly calling odd commands.\nYou can make the value begin with a hyphen, then the usual command line\nwill put afterward and the hyphen removed. The suggested use for this is\nadding `command\\' or `builtin\\' to make sure the right version of\na command is called.\nThe completion system allows you to type the name of a command, for\nexample `emacs\\', which will be converted to a PID. Note that this is\ndifferent from a job name beginning with `%\\'; in this case, any\ncommand listed by ps, given the setting of the command style, can be\nused. Obviously, command names can be ambiguous, unlike the process IDs\nthemselves, so the names are usually converted immediately to PIDs; if\nthe name could refer to more than one process, you get a menu of\npossible PIDs.\nThe style insert-ids allows the completion system to keep using the\nnames rather than the PIDs. If it is set to single, the name will be\nretained until you type enough to identify a particular process. If it\nis set to true (or anything else but menu, actually), menu\ncompletion is delayed until you have typed a string longer than the\ncommon prefix of the PIDs. This is intended to be similar to\ncompletion\\'s usual logic --- don\\'t do anything which gets rid of\ninformation supplied by the user --- so is probably more useful in\npractice than it sounds.\nJob control: numbers\\\nBuiltin functions that take process IDs usually also take job\nspecifications, strings beginning with `%\\' and followed either by a\nsmall number or a string. The style numbers determines how these are\ncompleted. By default, the completion system will try to complete an\nunambiguous string from the name of the job. If you set numbers to\ntrue, it will instead complete the job number --- though the listing\nwill still show the full information --- and if you set it to a\nnumber, it will only use that many words of the job name, and switch to\nusing numbers if those are not unique. In other words, if you set it to\n`1\\' and you have two jobs `vi foo\\' and `vi bar\\', then they\nwill complete as `%1\\' and `%2\\' (or maybe other numbers) since\nthe first words are the same.\nNote also that prefix-needed applies here; if it is set, you need to\ntype the `%\\' to complete jobs rather than processes.\nSystem information: users, groups, hosts etc.\\\nThere are many occasions where you complete the names of users on the\nsystem, groups on the system (not to be confused with completion\ngroups), names of other hosts you connect to via the network, and ports,\nwhich are essentially the names of internet services available on\nanother host such as nntp or smtp.\nBy default, the completion system will query the usual system files to\nfind the names of users, groups, hosts and ports, though in the final\ncase it will only look in the file `/etc/hosts\\', which often\nincludes only a very small number of not necessarily very useful hosts.\nIt is possible to tell the completion system always to use a specified\nset by setting the appropriate style --- users, groups, hosts,\nports --- to the set of possibilities you want. This is nearly\nalways useful with hosts, and on some systems you may find it takes an\ninordinate amount of time for the system to query the database for\ngroups and users, so you may want to specify a subset containing just\nthose you use most often.\nThere are also three sets of combinations: hosts-ports,\nhosts-ports-users and users-hosts. These are used for commands which\ncan take both or all three arguments. Currently, the command socket uses\nhosts-ports, telnet uses hosts-ports-users, while the style\nusers-hosts is used by remote login commands such as rsh and ssh,\nand anywhere the form `user@host\\' is valid.\nThe last is probably the most useful, so I\\'ll illustrate that. By\nsetting:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' users-hosts \\ \n    pws:foo.bar.uk peters@frond.grub.uk\nyou tell rsh and friends the possible user/host combinations. Note\nthat for the separator you can use either `:\\', as usual inside the\ncompletion system, or `@\\', which is more natural in this particular\ncase. If you type `rsh -l\\', a username is expected and either pws\nor peters will be completed. Suppose you picked pws; then for the\nnext argument, which should be a host, the system now knows that it must\nbe foo.bar.uk, since the username for the other host doesn\\'t match.\nIf you don\\'t need that much control, completion for all these commands\nwill survive on just the basic `hosts\\', `users\\', etc. styles; it\nsimply won\\'t be as clever in recognising particular combinations. In\nfact, even if you set the combined styles, anything that doesn\\'t match\nwill be looked up in the corresponding basic style, so you can\\'t lose,\nin principle.\nThe other combined styles work in exactly the same way; just set the\nvalues separated by colons or `@\\', it doesn\\'t matter which.\nURLs for web browsers\\\nCompletion for URLs is done by setting a parallel path somewhere on your\nlocal machine. The urls style specifies the top directory for this.\nFor example, to complete the URL http://zsh.org/, you need to make a\nset of subdirectories of the path directory http/zsh.org/. You can\nextend this for however many levels of directory you need; as you would\nexpect, if the last object is a file rather than a directory you should\ncreate it with `touch\\' rather than `mkdir\\'. The style will\nalways use the tag `urls\\' for this purpose, i.e. the context always\nmatches `:completion:*:urls\\'. This is a neat way of using the\nordinary filing system for doing the dirty work of turning URLs into\ncomponents. Arguably the system should be able to scan your browser\\'s\nbookmarks file, but currently it won\\'t; there is, however, a tool\nprovided with the shell distribution in Misc/make-zsh-urls which\nshould be able to help --- ask your system administrators about this\nif it isn\\'t installed, I\\'m sure they\\'ll be delighted to help.\nIf you only have a few URLs you want to complete, you can use one of two\nsimpler forms for the urls style. First, if the value of the style\ncontains more than one word, the values are used directly as the URLs to\nbe completed, e.g.:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:urls' urls \\ \n      http://www.foo.org/ ftp://ftp.bar.net\nAlternatively, you can set the urls style to the name of a normal\nfile, which contains the URLs to complete separated by white space or\nnewlines.\nNote that many modern browsers allow you to miss out an initial\n`http://\\', and that lots of pseudo-URLs appear in newspapers and\nadvertisements without it. The completion system needs it, however.\nThere is a better way when the web pages actually happen to be hosted on\na system whose directories you can access directly. Set the local\nstyle to an array of three strings: a hostname to be considered local\n(you can only give one per context), the directory corresponding to the\nroot of the files, and the directory where a user places their own web\npages, relative to their home directory. For example, if your home page\nis usually retrieved as http://www.footling.com/, and that looks for\nthe index file (often called index.html) in the directory\n/usr/local/www/files, and your own web pages live under `~/www\\',\nthen you would set\n  zstyle ':completion:*:urls' local \\ \n      www.footling.com /usr/local/www/files www\nand when you type `lynx http://www.footling.com/\\', all the rest will\nbe completed automatically.\nThe X files\\\nThere is another use for the path style with the tag `colors\\': it\ngives the path to a file which contains a list of colour names\nunderstood by the X-windows system, usually in file named `rgb.txt\\'.\nThis is used in such contexts as `xsetroot -solid\\', which completes\nthe name of a colour to set your root window (wallpaper) to. It may be\nthat the default value works on your system without your needing to set\nthis.\n[]{#l160}\n6.6: Command widgets\n[]{#l161}\n6.6.1: _complete_help\nYou\\'ve already met this, usually bound to `^Xh\\' unless you already\nhad that bound when completion started up (in which case you should pick\nyour own binding and use `bindkey\\'), but don\\'t forget it, since\nit\\'s by far the easiest way of finding out what context to use for\nsetting particular styles.\n[]{#l162}\n6.6.2: _correct_word, _correct_filename, _expand_word\nThe first and last of these have been mentioned in describing the\nrelated completers: _correct_word, usually bound to ^Xc, calls the\n_correct completer directly to perform spelling correction on the\ncurrent word, and _expand_word, usually bound to ^Xe, does the same\nwith the _expand completer. The contexts being\n`:completion:complete-word\\' and `:completion:expand-word\\'\nrespectively, so that they can be distinguished in styles from the\nordinary use of the completer. If you want the same styles to be used in\nboth contexts, but not others, you should define them for patterns\nbeginning `:completion:complete(|-word)...\\'.\nThe middle one simply corrects filenames, regardless of the completion\ncontext. Unlike the others, it can also be called as an ordinary\nfunction: pass it an argument, and it will print out the possible\ncorrections. It does this because it bypasses most of the usual\ncompletion system. Probably you won\\'t often need it, but it is usually\nbound to `^XC\\' (note the capital `C\\').\n[]{#l163}\n6.6.3: _history_complete_word\nThis is usually bound to `\\' for completing back in the\nhistory, and `\\' for completing forward --- this will\nautomatically turn on menu completion, temporarily if you don\\'t\nnormally have that set, to cycle through the matches. It will complete\nwords from the history list, starting with the most recent. Hence\n  touch supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\n  cat sup\nwill save you quite a bit of typing --- although in this particular\ncase, you can use `\\' to insert the last word of the previous\ncommand.\nVarious styles are available. You can set the `stop\\' style which\nmakes it stop once before cycling past the end (or beginning) of the\nhistory list, telling you that the end was reached.\nYou can also set the `list\\' style to force matches to be listed, the\n`sort\\' style to sort matches in alphabetical order instead of by\ntheir age in the history list, and the `remove-all-dups\\' style,\nwhich ensures that each match only occurs once in the completion list\n--- normally consecutive identical matches are removed, but the code\ndoes not bother searching for identical matches elsewhere in the list of\npossibilities. Finally, the range style is supported via the\n_history completer, which does the work. This style restricts the\nnumber of history words to be searched for matches and is most useful if\nyour history list is large. Setting it to a number n specifies that\nonly the last n history words should be searched for possible matches.\nAlternatively, it can be a value of the form `max:slice\\', in\nwhich case it will search through the last slice history words for\nmatches, and only if it doesn\\'t find any, the slice words before\nthat; max gives an overall limit on the maximum number of words to\nsearch through.\n[]{#l164}\n6.6.4: _most_recent_file\nThis function is normally bound to `^Xm\\'. It simply completes the\nmost recently modified file that matches what\\'s on the line already.\nAny pattern characters in the existing string are active, so this is a\ncross between expansion and completion. You can also give it a numeric\nprefix to show the Nth most recently modified file that matches the\npattern.\nBy the way, you can actually do the same by setting appropriate styles,\nwithout any new functions. The trick is to persuade the system to use\nthe normal _files completer with the file-sort style. By restricting\nthe use of the styles to the context of the widget --- which is simply\nthe _generic completer described above:\n  zstyle ':completion:(match-word|most-recent-file):*' \\ \n      match-original both\n  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file::::' completer \\ \n      _menu _files _match\n  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' file-sort modification\n  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' file-patterns \\ \n      '*(.):normal\\ files'\n  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' hidden true\n  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*:descriptions' format ''\n  bindkey '^Xm' most-recent-file\n  zle -C most-recent-file menu-complete _generic\nIt may not be obvious how this works, so here\\'s a blow by blow account\nif you are interested. (It works even if you aren\\'t interested,\nhowever.)\n\nThe `zle -C\\' defines a widget which does menu completion, and\nbehaves like ordinary completion (that\\'s what _generic is for)\nexcept that the context uses the name of the widget we define.\nWhen we invoke the widget, the system uses the completer style to\ndecide what completions to perform. This instructs it: use menu\ncompletion, complete files, use pattern matching if the completion\nso far didn\\'t work.\nFirst, _menu comes along; it actually does nothing more than tell\nthe system to use menu completion.\nThen _files generates a list of files. This uses the file-sort\nand file-patterns styles defined for the most-recent-file\ncontext. They produce a set of files in modification time order, and\ninclude only regular files (so not directories, symlinks, device\nfiles and so on).\nIf that failed, the _match style allows the word on the command\nline to be treated as a pattern; for example, *.c to complete the\nmost recent C source file. This uses the match-original style; the\nsetting tells it that it should try first without adding an extra\n`*\\' for matching (this is what we want for the case where we\nalready have a complete pattern like *.c), and if that fails, add\na * at the end and try again.\nThe hidden style means that the matches aren\\'t listed; all that\nhappens is the first is inserted on the line. The setting for the\nformat tag similarly simplifies the display in this case by\nremoving verbose descriptions.\nThe net result is the first step of a menu completion: insert the\nfirst matched file (the most recently modified) onto the line. This\nis exactly what you want. Note, however, that as we are in menu\ncompletion you can keep on hitting ^xm and the shell will cycle\nthrough the matches, which here gives you files that are\nprogressively less recently modified.\n\nOmit the file-patterns line if you don\\'t want the match restricted to\nregular files (I sometimes need the most recently modified directory,\nbut often it\\'s irrelevant). The whole version using styles comes from\nOliver Kiddle, who recommends using _generic in this way any time you\nwant to generate a widget from a specific completion such as _files.\nThere is a brief section on _generic below.\n[]{#l165}\n6.6.5: _next_tags\nThis is a very neat way of getting round the order of tags just with a\nkey sequence. An example is the best way of showing it; it\\'s bound by\ndefault to the key sequence `^Xn\\'.\n  % tex ^D\n  Completing TeX or LaTeX file\n  bar.tex   foo.tex   guff.tex\nOur file is not in that directory, but by default we don\\'t get to see\nthe directory if there was a file that matched the pattern --- here\n`*.tex\\'. (This will actually change in 4.1, since most people don\\'t\nknow about _next_tags but do know about directories, but you can still\ncycle through the different sets of tags.) You can set the tag-order\nstyle to alter whether they appear at the same time, but _next_tags\nlets you do this very simply. Just hit ^Xn. You\\'re now looking at\n  Completing TeX or LaTeX file\n  dir1/  dir2/  dir3/\nand if you carry on hitting ^Xn you will get to all files, and then\nyou will be taken back to the .tex files again. (Where our file\nactually is, is left as an exercise for the reader.)\nOf course this works with any set of tags whatsover; it simply has the\neffect of cycling you around the tag order.\n[]{#l166}\n6.6.6: _bash_completions\nThis function provides compatibility with a set of completion bindings\nin bash, in which escape followed by one of the following characters\ncauses a certain type of (non-contextual) completion: `!\\', command\nnames; `$\\', environment variables; `@\\', host names; `/\\',\nfilenames, and `~\\' user names. `^X\\' followed by the same\ncharacters causes the possible completion to be listed. This function\ndecides by examining its own binding which of those it should be doing,\nthen calls the appropriate completion function. If you want to use it\nfor all those possible bindings, you need to issue the right statements\nin your .zshrc, since only the bindings with `~\\' are set up by\ndefault to avoid clashes. This will do it:\n  for key in '!' '$' '@' '/'; do\n    bindkey \"\\e$key\" _bash_complete-word\n    bindkey \"^X$key\" _bash_list-choices\n  done\nUnlike most widgets, which are tied to functions of the same name to\nminimize confusion, the function _bash_completions is actually called\nunder the names of the two different widgets shown in that code so as to\nbe able to implement both completion and listing behaviour.\n[]{#l167}\n6.6.7: _read_comp\nThis function, usually bound to `^X^R\\', does on-the-fly completion.\nWhen you call it, it prompts for you to enter a type of completion;\nusually this will be the name of a completion function with the required\narguments. Thus it\\'s not much use unless you already have some fairly\nin-depth knowledge of how the system is set up. For example, try it,\nthen enter `_files -/\\', which generates directories. There is a\nrudimentary completion for the function names built into it.\nThe next time you start it up, it will produce the same type of\ncompletion. You need to give it a numeric prefix to tell it to prompt\nfor a different sort.\n[]{#l168}\n6.6.8: _generic\nRather than being directly bound, like the others, this widget gives you\na way of creating your own special completions. You define it as a\nwidget and bind it as if it were any completion function:\n  zle -C foo complete-word _generic\n  bindkey '' foo\nNow the keys bound will perform ordinary contextual completion, but any\nstyles will be looked up with the command context `foo\\'. So you can\ngive it its own set of completers:\n  zstyle ':completion:foo:*' completer _expand\nand, indeed, give it special values for any style you like. To put it\nanother way, you\\'ve now got a complete, separate copy of the completion\nsystem where the only difference is the extra word in the context.\nGood example of the use of this function were given above in the\ndescriptions of _all_matches and _most_recent_file.\n[]{#l169}\n6.6.9: predict-on, incremental-complete-word\nThese are not really complete commands at all in the strict sense, they\nare normal editing commands which happen to have the effect of\ncompletion. This means that they are not part of the completion system,\nand though they are installed with other shell functions they will not\nautomatically be loaded. You will therefore need an explicit\n`autoload -U predict-on\\', etc. --- remember that the `-U\\'\nprevents the functions from expanding any of your own aliases when they\nare read in --- as well as an explicit `bindkey\\' command to bind\neach function, and a `zle -N\\' statement to tell the line editor that\nthe function is to be regarded as an editing widget. The predict-on\nfile, when loaded, actually defines two functions, predict-on and\npredict-off, both of which need to be defined and bound for them to\nwork. So to use all of these,\n  autoload -U incremental-complete-word predict-on\n  zle -N incremental-complete-word\n  zle -N predict-on\n  zle -N predict-off\n  bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word\n  bindkey '^Xp' predict-on\n  bindkey '^X^P' predict-off\n`Prediction\\' is a sort of dynamic history completion. With\npredict-on in effect, the line editor will try to retrieve a line back\nin the history which matches what you type. If it does, it will show the\nline, extending past the current cursor position. You can then edit the\nline; characters which do not insert anything mostly behave as normal.\nIf you continue to type, and what you type does not match the line which\nwas found, the line editor will look further back for another line; if\nno line matches, editing is essentially as normal. Often this is\nflexible enough that you can leave predict-on in effect, but you can\nreturn to basic editing with predict-off.\nNote that, with prediction turned on, deleting characters reverses the\ndirection of the history search, so that you go back to previous lines,\nlike an ordinary incremental search; unfortunately the previous line\nfound could be one you\\'ve already half-edited, because they don\\'t\ndisappear from the list until you finally hit `return\\' on an edited\nline to accept it. There\\'s another problem with moving around the line\nand inserting characters somewhere else: history searching will resume\nas soon as you try to insert the new characters, which means everything\non the right of the cursor is liable to disappear again. So in that case\nyou need to turn prediction off explicitly. A final problem: prediction\nis bad with multi-line buffers.\nIf prediction fails with predict-on active, completion is\nautomatically tried. The context for this looks like\n`:completion:predict::::\\'. Various styles are useful at this point:\n`list\\' could be set to always, which will show a possible\ncompletion even if there is only one, for example. The style\n`cursor\\' may have the values `complete\\' to move to the end of\nthe word completed, `key\\' to move past the rightmost occurrence of\nthe character just typed, allowing you just to keep typing, or anything\nelse not to move the cursor which is the default behaviour.\nThe incremental-complete-word function allows you to see a list of\npossible completions as you type them character by character after the\nfirst. The function is quite basic; it is really just an example of\nusing various line editor facilities, and needs some work to make a\nuseful system. It will understand DEL to delete the previous\ncharacter, return to accept, ^G to abort, TAB to complete the word\nas normal and ^D to list possibilities; otherwise, keys which do not\ninsert are unlikely to have a useful effect. The completion is done\nbehind the scenes by the standard function complete-word.\n[]{#l170}\n6.7: Matching control and controlling where things are inserted\nThe final matter before I delve into the system for writing new\ncompletion functions is matching control; the name refers in this case\nto how the matching between characters already typed on the command line\nand characters in a trial completion is performed. This can be done in\ntwo ways: by setting the matcher-list style, which applies to all\ncompletions, or by using an argument (-M) to the low-level completion\nfunctions. Mostly we will be concerned with the first. All this is best\nillustrated by examples, which are taken from the section `Matching\nControl\\' in the zshcompwid manual page; in the printed manual and\nthe `info\\' pages this occurs within the section\n`Completion Widgets\\'.\nThe matcher-list style takes an array value. The values will be tried\nin order from left to right. For example,\n  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z-}={A-Z_}' \\ \n         'r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*'\ntries the first specification, which is for case-insensitive completion,\nand if no matches are generated tries the second, which does partial\nword completion; I\\'ll explain both these specifications in detail as we\ngo along. You can make it do both forms the second time round simply by\ncombining the values with a space, i.e. the last word on the command\nline becomes 'm:{a-z-}={A-Z_} r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*'. It is also perfectly\nvalid to have a first matcher empty, i.e. '``'; this means that\ncompletion is tried with no matching rule the first time, and will only\ngo on to subsequent matchers in the list if that fails. This is quite a\ngood practice as it avoids surprises.\n[]{#l171}\n6.7.1: Case-insensitive matching\nTo perform case-insensitive matching for all completions, you can set:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'\nThe `m:\\' specifies standard matching, with the `{a-z}\\'\ndescribing what\\'s on the command line, and the `{A-Z}\\' what\\'s in\nthe trial completion. The braces indicate `correspondence classes\\',\nwhich are not lessons taken by email (that\\'s a joke), but a relative of\nthe more usual character classes like `[a-z]\\', which, as you no\ndoubt know, would match any of the letters between a and z. In this\ncontext, with the braces, the letters are forced to match on the left\nand right hand side of the `=\\', so an `a\\' on the command line\nmust match an `A\\' in the trial completion, a `b\\' must match a\n`B\\', and so on. Since an a in the command line will always match\nan `a\\' in the trial completion, matcher or no matcher, this means\nthat if you type an `a\\' it will match either `a\\' or `A\\'\n--- in other words, case-insensitively. The same goes for any other\nlowercase letter you type. The difference from `m:[a-z]=[A-Z]\\' is\nthat, because ordinary character classes are unordered, any lowercase\nletter would have matched any uppercase letter, which isn\\'t what you\nwant. The rest of the shell doesn\\'t know about correspondence classes\nat all.\nFinally, the use of a lowercase `m\\' at the start means that the\ncharacters actually inserted onto the line are those from the trial\ncompletion --- if you type `make\\', the completion process\ngenerates file names, and matcher-list allows what you type to match\nthe file `Makefile\\', then you need the latter to be inserted on the\ncommand line. Use of `M:\\' at the start of the matcher would keep\nwhatever was on the line to begin with there.\nIf you want completely case-insensitive matching, so that typing\n`MAKE\\' would also potentially complete to `Makefile\\' or\n`makefile\\' (and so on), the extension is fairly obvious:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'\nbecause now as well as `a\\' matching `A\\', `A\\' will match\n`a\\' --- and, of course, `a\\' and `A\\' each still match\nthemselves.\nMore detail on the patterns: they do not, in fact, allow all the\npossible patterns you can use elsewhere in the shell, since that would\nbe too complicated to implement with little extra use. Apart from\ncharacter classes and correspondence classes, you can use `?\\' which\nhas its usual meaning of matching one character, or literal characters,\nwhich match themselves; or the pattern for the trial completion only can\nbe a single `*\\'. which matches anything. That\\'s it, however; you\ncan\\'t do other things with the `*\\' since it\\'s too difficult for\nthe system to guess what characters should be covered by it.\nFor the same reason, the `*\\' must be in an anchored pattern, the\nidea behind which is shown in the next example.\n[]{#l172}\n6.7.2: Matching option names\nI explained back in chapter 1 that zsh didn\\'t\ncare too much how you specified options: `noglob\\' and `NOGLOB\\'\nand `No_Glob\\' and `__NO_GLOB_\\' are all treated the same way.\nAlso, this is the negation of the option `glob\\'. Having learnt how\nto match case-insensitively, we have two further challenges: how to\nignore a `_\\' anywhere in the word, and how to ignore the NO at the\nbeginning so that we can complete an unnegated option name after it.\nWell, here\\'s how. Since you don\\'t want this for all completions, just\nfor option names, I shall show it as an argument for the `compadd\\'\ncommand, which gives the system the list of possible completions. The\noption names should then appear as the remaining arguments to the\ncommand, and the easiest way of doing that is to have the\nzsh/parameter module loaded, which it always is for new completion,\nand use the keys of the special associative array $options:\n  compadd -M 'B:|[nN][oO]= M:_= M:{A-Z}={a-z}' - ${(k)options}\nHere, we\\'re interested in the thing in quotes --- it means exactly\nthe same here as it would as an element of the matcher list, except that\nit only applies to the trial completions given after the `-\\'. It\\'s\nin three bits, separated by spaces; as they\\'re in the same word, all\nare applied one after the other regardless of any previous ones having\nmatched.\nStarting from the right, you can see that the last part matches letters\ncase-insensitively; the capital `M\\' means that, this time, the\nletters on the command line, not those in the trial completion are kept;\nthis is safe because of the way options are parsed, and reduces\nunexpected changes.\nMoving left, you can now guess `M:_=\\': it means that the `_\\'\nmatches nothing at all in the trial completion --- in other words, it\nis simply ignored. The rule for matching across the `=\\' is that you\nmove from left to right, pairing off characters or elements of character\nclasses as I already described, and when you run out, you treat any\nmissing characters as, well, missing.\nThe first part has an `anchor\\', indicated by what lies between the\n`:\\' and the `|\\'. The B specifies that the case insensitive\nmatch of `no\\' must occur at the start of the word on the command\nline (with `b\\' it would be the word in the list of matches), but\nhere it is lax enough to allow this to happen after the `M:_=\\' has\nstripped any initial underscores away. Hence it matches no, NO, No\nor nO at the start of the string, and, just like the `M:_=\\' part,\nit ignores it, since there\\'s nothing on the right. Again, the capital\n`B\\' at the start means keep what\\'s on the command line: that\\'s\nimportant in this case, since if you lost the `no\\', the meaning\nwould change completely.\nSo consider the combined effect when trying to complete NO_GL. The\nfirst specification allows it to match against _GL; the second allows\nit to match against GL; the third, against gl; and finally the usual\neffect of completion means that any option beginning gl may be\ncompleted. Try `setopt NO_GL^D\\' and you should see something like:\n  NO_GLob           NO_GLobassign     NO_GLobdots                       \n  NO_GLobalrcs      NO_GLobcomplete   NO_GLobsubst                      \n--- after the bit you\\'ve typed, the form of the words reverts to\nwhatever\\'s in the trial completion, i.e. lowercase letters with no\n`_\\'s.\n[]{#l173}\n6.7.3: Partial word completion\nThis example shows the other sort of anchoring, on the right, and also\nhow to use a `*\\' in the right hand part of a pattern. Consider:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'r:|.=* r:|=*'\nThe `r:\\' specifies a right-anchored match, using the characters from\nthe trial completion rather than what\\'s already on the command line. As\nthe anchor is on the right this time, the pattern (between `:\\' and\n`|\\') is empty, and its anchor (between `|\\' and `=\\') is\n`.\\'. So this specifies that nothing --- a zero length string, or a\ngap between characters if you want to think of it like that --- when\nfollowed by a `.\\', matches anything at all in the trial completion.\nConsequently, the second part says that nothing anchored on the right by\nnothing --- in other words, the right hand end of the command line\nstring --- matches anything. This is what completion normally does,\nadd anything at all at the end of the string; we\\'ve added this part to\nthe matcher in case the cursor is in the middle of the word. It means\nthat the right hand end will always be completed, too.\nLet\\'s see that in action. Here are the actual contents of my actual\ntmp directory, never mind why:\n  regframe.rpm  t.c  testpage.dvi  testpage.log  testpage.ps\nNow I set the matcher-list style as above and type:\n  echo t.p\nand get\n  echo testpage.ps\nSo, apart from the normal completion at the end (p to ps), the empty\nstring followed by a . was allowed to match anything, too, and I got\nthe effect of completing both bits of the word.\nYou might wonder what happens when there\\'s a file testpage.old.ps\naround, i.e. the anchor appears twice in that. With the matcher set as\ngiven above, that won\\'t be completed; the anchor needs to be matched\nexplicitly, not by a wildcard. If you don\\'t like that, you can change\nthe `*\\' after the `=\\' in the specification to `**\\'; this\nform allows the anchor to occur in the string being matched. You can\nthink of `*\\' and `**\\' as taking the shortest and the longest\npossible matches respectively. If you use a lot of `**\\'\nspecifications in your matches, things can get very confusing, however.\nOther shells have a facility for completing inside words like this,\nwhere it goes by such names as `enhanced\\' completion, although it is\nusually not so flexible. In the case of tcsh, not just `.\\' but also\n`-\\' and `_\\' have this effect. You can force this with\n  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'r:|[._-]=* r:|=*'\n[]{#l174}\n6.7.4: Substring completion\nI\\'ve mentioned `r\\' and `B\\', but corresponding to `r\\' there\nis `l\\', which anchors on the left instead of the right, and\ncorresponding to `B\\' there is `E\\' which matches at the end\ninstead of the beginning; and, of course, all exist in both upper- and\nlowercase forms, meaning `keep what the user typed\\' and `keep what is\nin the list of possible matches\\', respectively.\nHere is an example of using `l:|=*\\' to match anything at the start\nof the word: this is the effect of having an empty anchor, as you saw\nwith `r\\' above, but note with `l\\', the anchor appears, logically\nenough, on the left of the `|\\', in the order they would appear on\nthe command line. By combining this with the `r\\' form, you can make\nthe completion system work when what is on the command line matches only\na substring of a trial completion --- i.e., has anything else on the\nleft and on the right. Since this can potentially generate a lot of\nmatches, it might by an idea to try it after any other matcher\nspecifications you have. So the following tries case-insensitive\ncompletion, then partial-word completion (case-sensitively), then\nsubstring completion:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' \\ \n         'r:|[._-]=* r:|=*' 'l:|=* r:|=*'\n[]{#l175}\n6.7.5: Partial words with capitals\nThis section illustrates another feature: if you use `||\\' when\nspecifying anchors for `L\\' or `R\\' or their lowercase variants,\nthe pattern part for what appears on the command line, which would\nusually be translated into some other pattern, is treated instead as\nanother anchor on the other side of the pattern --- which isn\\'t\nmatched against the pattern in the word, it just has to appear. In other\nwords, this part matches without being `swallowed up\\' in the process.\nAn example (again adapted from the manual) will make this clearer.\n  compadd -M 'r:[^A-Z0-9]||[A-Z0-9]=** r:|=*' \\ \n          LikeTHIS LooHoo foo123 bar234\nThe four possible completions are on the second line. The second of the\ntwo matcher specifications just allows anything to match on the right,\nso if we are inside the word, the remainder may be completed. The first\nword is where the action is; it says `A part of the completion which\nhas on the left something other than an upper case letter or a digit,\nand on the right an upper case letter or a digit, may match anything,\nincluding the anchor\\'. So in particular, this would allow `LH\\' to\ncomplete to `LooHoo\\' --- and only that, since `LikeTHIS\\' has\nan uppercase letter to the left of the `H\\', which is not allowed. In\nother words, the chunks of word beginning with uppercase letters and\ndigits act like the start of substrings. (If you like, remember that\nlast sentence and the specification, and forget the rest.)\n[]{#l176}\n6.7.6: Final notes\nTo put everything together, the possible specifications are\n`m:...=...\\', `l:...|...=...\\', `r:...|...=...\\',\n`b:...|...=...\\' and `e:...|...=...\\', which cause the command\nline to be altered to the match found, and their counterparts with an\nuppercase letter, which cause what\\'s already on the command line to be\nleft alone and the remaining characters to be inserted directly from the\ncompletion found. The `...\\' are patterns, which all use the same\nformat. They can include literal characters, a `?\\', and character or\ncorrespondence classes, while the rightmost pattern in each type may\nalso consist of a `*\\' on its own. Characters are matched from left\nto right; a missing character matches an empty string, `*\\' matches\nany number of characters. Specifications may be joined in a single\nstring, in which case all parts will be applied together.\nWhen using the matcher-list style, a list of different specifications\ncan be given; in this case, they will be tried in turn until one of them\ngenerates matches, and the rest will not be used.\nThere\\'s another style apart from matcher-list, called matcher. This\ncan be set for a particular context, possibly with specific tags, and\nwill add the given matcher specifications using exactly the same syntax\nas matcher-list for that context, except that here all specifications\nare used at once, even if they are given as different elements of an\narray. This is possibly useful because matcher-list is only aware of\nthe completer, not of any more specific part of the context.\nAlthough I won\\'t talk about matching control after this section, there\nmay be cases where you want to include `compadd -M ...\\' in a\ncompletion function of your own to help the user. Many of the existing\ncompletion functions provide partial word completion where it seems\nuseful; for example, completion of zle functions allows i-c-w to be\ncompleted to incremental-complete-word in this way.\nActually, you can configure this to a considerable extent without\naltering a function, using styles and labelled tags. From the manual:\n  zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*' tag-order '*' '*:-case'\n  zstyle ':completion:*-case' matcher 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'\nIn command foo, whatever the tags are, they are to be tried normally\nfirst (the `*\\' argument to tag-order), then under the same name\nwith `-case\\' appended. The second style defines a matcher for any\ntag ending in the suffix `-case\\', which allows lowercase characters\nto match uppercase ones. The upshot is that completion of anything at\nall for the command foo will be tried first case-sensitively, then\ncase-insensitively.\n[]{#l177}\n6.8: Tutorial\nBefore bamboozling you with everything there is to know about writing\nyour own completion function, I\\'ll give you an example of something I\nwrote myself recently. If you were doing this yourself, you would then\njust stick this function somewhere in your function search path, and\nnext time you started the shell it would start doing its work. However,\nthe file already exists: it\\'s called _perforce and you should find it\nin the function search for versions 4.1.1 and above of zsh. I apologize\nif it\\'s not the ideal function to start with, but it is fresh in my\nmind, so what I\\'m saying has some chance of being correct.\nThis section is subtitled, `How I struggled to write a set of\ncompletions for Perforce\\'. Perforce is a commercial configuration\nmanagement tool (as they now call revision control systems); consult\nhttp://www.perforce.com/ for details. It\\'s concepts aren\\'t a million\nmiles from CVS, the archetypal system of this kind, but it was\nsufficiently different that the completion functions needed rewriting\nfrom the ground up. You won\\'t need to know anything about CVS or\nPerforce, because at each stage I\\'ll explain what I\\'m trying to\ncomplete and why. This should give you plenty of meat for writing\ncompletions of your own. After the tutorial, the chapter goes into the\nindividual details, which will expand on some of the things that\nappeared briefly in the tutorial.\nWhat I tend to find the most complicated part of this is making sure the\ncompletion system knows the correct types of completions and their tags\nto be completed at once. This probably won\\'t be your first priority\nwhen trying to write completions of your own, but if you do it right,\nall the stuff about selecting types and arranging them in groups that I\nshowed above will just work. In this tutorial we arrange to use enough\nof the higher level functions that it will work without too much\n(apparent) effort. Of course, working out from scratch which those\nfunctions are isn\\'t always that easy; hence the tutorial.\nNeedless to say, I will simplify grossly at a lot of points. You can see\nthe finished product in the zsh 4.1 distribution. It even has a few\ncomments in.\nBasic structure\\\nLike the cvs command and a few other of the more complicated commands\nyou might use, Perforce is run by a single command, p4, followed by an\nargument giving the particular Perforce command, followed by an options\nand arguments to that command.\nThis dictates the basic tasks the completion functions must do:\n\nIf we are in the first argument, complete the name of the\nsubcommand.\nIf we are in a subsequent argument, look up the name of the\nsubcommand and call the function which handles its arguments.\n\nThis is more complicated than most commands you will write completions\nfor. However, one useful feature of the completion system is you can do\ncompletions in a recursive fashion. So once you get to the point where\nyou are handling arguments for a particular subcommand, you can\ncompletely forget about the first step --- as if the subcommand was\nthe command on the line.\nIn addition to the subcommands, there are lots of other types of object\nPerforce knows about: files, obviously, plus revisions of files, set of\nchanges (`changelists\\') applied at once, numbers of fixes applied to\nfiles (essentially a way of tying changlists to a particular change\nrequest for bugtracking purposes), types of file --- text, binary,\netc., and several others. We will break down each of these completions\ninto its own function. That means that any time we need to complete a\nparticular type of object, wherever it appears (and many of these\nobjects can appear in lots of different places), we just call the same\nfunction.\nHence there are a large number of different functions:\n\nThe main dispatcher for the command, called _perforce for clarity\n--- the main command it handles is `p4\\', but the name Perforce\nis more familiar.\nOne function for each subcommand.\nOne function for each type of object Perforce knows about and we\ncomplete (we don\\'t bother completing dates, for example).\nIn some cases, in particular files, multiple functions since there\nare different types of file --- regular files and directories\ncompleted in the normal way, files completed by asking Perforce\nwhere it has stored them, files opened for some form of change to be\nmade to them, and so on. Each of these is completed by a different\nfunction.\n\nThis makes it impractical to put all the functions in separate files\nsince editing them would be a nightmare. What\\'s more, since we will\nalways go through the dispatcher _perforce, we don\\'t need to tell the\nshell to autoload all the other functions; it can just hook them in from\nthe main file. The file _perforce therefore has the structure:\n  #compdef p4\n  # Main dispatcher\n  _perforce() {\n    # ...\n  }\n\n  # Helper functions for the various types of object\n\n  _perforce_files() {\n    # ...\n  }\n\n  # ...\n\n  # Dispatchers for the individual subcommands.\n\n  _perforce_cmd_help() {\n    # ...\n  }\n\n  # Code to make sure _perforce is run when we load it\n  _perforce \"$@\"\nThat last line is probably the least obvious. It\\'s because of the fact\nthat zsh (unlike other shells) usually treats the file of an autoloaded\nfunction as being the body of the function. Since everything else here\njust defines a function, without the last line nothing would happen the\nfirst time it was run; it would define _perforce and all the other\nfunctions, but that was it. The last line makes sure _perforce gets\nrun with all the arguments passed down. The shell is smart enough to\nknow that the _perforce function we defined in the file is the one to\nkeep for future use, not the entire file, so from then on things are\neasy; we just have a complete set of ready-defined files.\nIn fact the various helper functions didn\\'t even need to use the\n`_\\' convention for completion functions, since the completion system\ndidn\\'t see them directly. However, I\\'ve kept it for consistency.\nThere\\'s one extra trick: apart from _perforce itself, the function\ndefinitions look like this:\n (( $+functions[_perforce_cmd_diff] )) ||\n  _perforce_cmd_diff() {\n    # body of function\n  }\nThis is to allow the user to override each function separately. The test\nuses the $functions special associative array from the zsh/parameter\nmodule, which the completion system loads. If the function is already\ndefined, because the corresponding element in the $functions parameter\nis set, then we skip the definition of the function here, because the\nuser has already defined it. So if you were to write your own\n_perforce_cmd_diff and put it into the function path, it would be\nused, as you no doubt intended.\n[]{#l178}\n6.8.1: The dispatcher\nThis top level is only necessary for complex commands with multiple\nsubcommands. There are interesting titbits here, but if you just want to\nknow how to complete a command with ordinary UNIX-style argument\nparsing, skip to the next section.\nThe main _perforce function has the two purposes described at the top\nof the previous subsection. We need to decide whether we are in the\nfirst word after the p4 command itself. A simple way of doing that is:\n  if (( CURRENT > 2 )); then\n    # Remember the subcommand name\n    local cmd=${words[2]}\n    # Set the context for the subcommand.\n    curcontext=\"${curcontext%:*:*}:p4-$cmd\"\n    # Narrow the range of words we are looking at to exclude `p4'\n    (( CURRENT-- ))\n    shift words\n    # Run the completion for the subcommand\n    _perforce_cmd_$cmd\n  else\n    local hline\n    local -a cmdlist\n    _call_program help-commands p4 help commands | while read -A hline; do\n      (( ${#hline} This already looks a bit horrific, but it breaks down quite easily. We\ntest the $CURRENT parameter, which is a special parameter in the\ncompletion system giving the word on the command line we are on. This is\nthe syntactic word --- the completion system has already done the hard\njob (and that\\'s not an overstatement, I can tell you) of deciding what\nmakes up a word on the command line, taking into account quoting and\nspecial characters. The array of words is stored, unsurprisingly, in the\narray $words. So word 1 will be `p4\\' and word 2 the subcommand.\nHence if we are past word 2, we look at ${words[2]} to get the\nsubcommand, and use that to decide what to do next. The change to\n$curcontext is a bit of cleverness to make it easy for the user to\ndefined styles for particular subcommands; refresh your mind by looking\nat the discussion of styles and contexts above if you need to. For\nexample, if you are completing after `p4 diff\\', the context will\nlook something like\n`:completion::complete:p4-diff:argument-1:opened-files\\' where the\nremainder says you are on the first argument and are complete the tag\n`opened-files\\', We\\'ll see down below how we tell the system to use\nthat tag; the `argument-1\\' is handled by the _arguments utility\nfunction, which takes away a lot of the load of handling options and\narguments in a standard UNIX format.\nNext, we pretend that the `p4\\' at the start wasn\\'t there by\nremoving the front of $words and decrementing $CURRENT so as to\nreflect its new position in $words. The reason for doing this is that\nwe are going to use _arguments for handling the subcommand. As is only\nsensible, this function looks at the first element of $words to find\nthe command word, and treats the rest as options or arguments to the\ncommand.\nWe then dispatch the right function for the command simply by\nconstructing the name of the function on the fly. Of course it\\'s a\nlittle neater to check the function exists first;\n$+functions[_perforce_cmd_$cmd] would come to our aid again.\nHowever, if we\\'re still on the second (original) word, we have to\ngenerate a list of functions to complete. We will do this by asking\nPerforce\\'s help system to list them, and store the results in the array\n$cmdlist. The loop has a couple of checks to remove blank lines and\nthe title line at the start. The remaining lines have a command and a\ndescription. We take the command, but also tack the description on after\na colon --- we can then show the user the description, too, as a bit\nof extra help.\nActually, the Perforce command that generates the list of subcommands is\nsimply `p4 help command\\'. (That\\'s really all you need to know; skip\nthe rest of the paragraph if you just want the basics.) The\n`_call_program help-commands\\' was stuck in front for the name of\nconfigurability. Before executing the command, the system checks in the\ncurrent context with the given tag help-commands for the style\ncommand. If it finds a value for that style, it will use that as the\ncommand to execute in the place of the remaining arguments. If the style\nit read began with -, then the command it was going to execute ---\ni.e. `p4 help commands\\' is appended to the end of the command read\nfrom the style, so that the user\\'s command can process the original\ncommand if it needs to. This is really extreme sophistication; you will\nrarely actually need the command style, but if you are writing a\ncompletion for others to use it\\'s polite to give them a chance to\nintercept calls in this way.\nThe _describe command then does the work for us. The\n`-t p4-commands\\' gives the tag we are going to use; the convention\nis that tag names are plural, though there\\'s nothing to enforce this.\nThen we give an overall description --- this is what appears after\n`Completing\\' in the examples of the format style above; if you\ndon\\'t have that set, you won\\'t see it. Finally, we give the array name\n--- note it is the name, not the substituted value. This is more\nefficient because the shell doesn\\'t need to extract the values until\nthe last minute; until then it can pass around just the single word. The\n_description function knows about the `completion:description\\'\nsyntax; reread what I said about the verbose style for what the system\ndoes with the descriptions for the completion.\nThe _describe function is one level above the completion system\\'s\nbasic builtin command, compadd; it just knows about a single tag, with\na little icing sugar to display verbose descriptions. Later, we\\'ll see\nways of building up alternatives where different types of completion can\nbe completed at the same point. There are lots of ways of doing this;\nsome of the more complicated are relegated to the detailed descriptions\nthat follow the tutorial.\n[]{#l179}\n6.8.2: Subcommand completion: _arguments\nSuppose we are now completing after `p4 diff\\'. We have altered the\ncommand line so that the function now sees the `diff\\' as the first\nword, as if this were the command. This makes the next step easier; the\n_arguments function won\\'t see irrelevant words on the command line,\nsince it is designed to handle the arguments to a simple command in the\nstandard form `command [ options ] arguments ...\\'. Here\\'s the\nsimple version.\n  _perforce_cmd_diff() {\n      _arguments -s : \\ \n          '-f[diff every file]' \\ \n          '-t[include non-text files]' \\ \n          '(-sd -se -sr)-sa[opened files, different or missing]' \\ \n          '(-sa -se -sr)-sd[unopened files, missing]' \\ \n          '(-sa -sd -sr)-se[unopened files, different]' \\ \n          '(-sa -sd -se)-sr[opened files, same as depot]' \\ \n          '-d-[select diff option]:diff option:'\\ \n  '((b\\:ignore\\ blanks c\\:context n\\:RCS s\\:summary'\\ \n  'u\\:unified w\\:ignore\\ all\\ whitespace))' \\ \n          \"*::file:_perforce_files\"\n  }\nI\\'ve split the argument beginning -d into three lines to fit, but\nit\\'s just a single argument. Also, for clarity I\\'ve missed out the\nline with the `$+functions\\' test to see if _perforce_cmd_diff was\nalready defined; I\\'ll forget about that for now.\nThe function _arguments has been described as having `the syntax from\nhell\\', but with the arguments already laid out in front of you it\ndoesn\\'t look so bad. The are three types of argument: options to\n_arguments itself, arguments saying how to handle options to the\ncommand (i.e. `p4 diff\\'), and arguments saying how to handle normal\narguments to the command.\nThe first two are for _arguments itself; `-s\\' tells it that\nsingle-letter options are allowed, i.e. they can be combined as in\n`-ft\\'. Luckily for our purposes, that doesn\\'t stop us having\nmultiple word options, too. The colon on its own then says everything\nelse is an argument relating to the command line being handled.\nWe then start off with some simple options; as you can probably guess\nstraight away, the first two say that `p4 diff -f\\' passes a flag to\nsay any file can be diff\\'ed (not just ones open for editing), and that\n`p4 diff -t\\' passes a flag to say that binary files can be diff\\'ed\n(not just text files). Note the use of square brackets for giving a\ndescription; this is handled by the verbose style as I mentioned for\n_describe. In fact, the list of possible options and arguments,\nsuitably rearranged, will end up passing through _describe. The\ndescriptions in square brackets are optional, as the use of square\nbrackets might suggest; you could just have `-f\\' and `-t\\'\n(making it fairly obvious why the `:\\' to separate off _arguments\\'s\nown options is a good idea).\nThe next step in complexity is that set of functions with the list in\nparentheses in front. These give mutually exclusive options. In other\nwords, if there\\'s already a -sa on the command line, don\\'t complete\nany of -sd, -se or -sr, and so on. (Remember that by default you\nneed to type the first `-\\' of an option, or the system will go\nstraight to normal arguments, which we\\'ll come to in a moment.)\nNext comes the specification for the option -d. All those colons\nindicate that this option has an argument, and the - following\nstraight after the -d indicates that it has to be in the same word,\ni.e. follow the -d without a space. After the first colon comes a\ndescription for the argument. This is what you see when you try to\ncomplete the after -d; compare this with the expression in square\nbrackets before, which is what you see when you try to complete the -d\nitself. Then after the second colon is an expression saying how to\ncomplete that argument.\nThis final part of the specification for an option with an argument can\ntake various forms. The simplest is just a single space; this means\nthere\\'s nothing to complete, but the system is aware the user needs to\ntype something for that word and can prompt with the description. The\nnext simplest is a set of words in parentheses: here, we could have had\n`(b c n s u w)\\'. Instead, we\\'ve had a variant on that which gives\nyet another set of descriptions, namely those for the individual\ncompletions that appear after -d. Note various things: the parentheses\nare doubled and the colons and spaces within the completion options are\nbackslashed. All of these are simply there to make it easy for\n_arguments to parse the string. The upshot of this is that in the\nfollowing context:\n p4 diff -d \na verbose completion using the format style as described above looks\nlike:\n  Completing diff option\n  b  # ignore blanks\n  c  # context\n  n  # RCS\n  s  # summary\n  u  # unified\n  w  # ignore all whitespace\nor similar --- I have the list-separator style set to `#\\',\nbecause it looks like a comment normal shell syntax, but in your case\nyou may get `-``-\\' as the separator.\n(In case you were wondering why the colons needed to be quoted when it\nseemed you\\'d already got to the last argument: it\\'s possible for\noptions to have multiple arguments, and you can continue having sets of\n:description:action pairs. This means the system needs some way\nof distinguishing these colons from ones inside arguments. While I\\'m\ndigressing, you may also have noticed that I could have written the\n-sX as an option with arguments, in which case you can have a bonus\npoint.)\nThe final argument starts with a `*\\', which means it applies to all\nremaining arguments to `p4 diff\\' after the options have been\nprocessed. Most of the rest is similar to the form for options, except\nfor the doubled colon, which indicates that $CURRENT and $words\nshould be altered to reflect only the arguments being handled by this\nargument specifier --- exactly what we did before calling\n_perforce_cmd_diff in the first place, in fact. As we mentioned\nbefore, this makes the next step of processing easier if happens to call\n_arguments again. (Actually it doesn\\'t in this case.) The `file\\'\nthen describes the arguments and the final part, _perforce_files,\ntells the system to call that function to complete a file name.\nThere are numerous (it sometimes seems, endless) subtleties to\n_arguments. I won\\'t try to go into them in the tutorial; see the\ndescription of _arguments below for something more detailed to refer\nto, and if you are feeling really brave look at the description in the\nzshcompsys manual page. Even better, dig into one of the existing\ncompletion functions --- something handling completion for a UNIX\ncommand is probably good, since these make heavy use of _arguments\n--- and see how those work. Despite the complexities, I would\ndefinitely suggest using _arguments wherever possible to take away any\nneed on your part to do processing of command line arguments.\n[]{#l180}\n6.8.3: Completing particular argument types\nNow we\\'ll look inside the _perforce_files function as an example of\nthe nitty gritty of completing one particular type of argument, which\nmight have some quite complicated internal structure. This is true in\nPerforce as the filename can have extra information tacked on the end:\n`file#revision\\' indicates the revision of a file,\n`file@change\\' indicates a change status, and in some cases you can\nget `file@change1,change2\\' to indicate a range of changes\n(likewise revisions). Furthermore, file can be specified in different\nways, and the file to be completed may be limited by some kind of\ncontext information. We\\'ll start from simple filenames and gradually\nadd these possibilities in.\nDifferent types of file, part 1\\\nThere are so many possibilities for files that I\\'m going to split up\n_perforce_files into individual functions handling different aspects.\nFor example, even if we are just handling ordinary files in the way the\ncompletion system normally does, Perforce commands understand a special\nfile name `...\\' which means `every subdirectory to any depth\\'.\n(Interestingly, zsh used to have this to mean the same thing, instead of\n`**\\'; it was changed in zsh because as the `.\\'s are regular\ncharacters there\\'s no easy way of quoting them. You didn\\'t need to\nknow this.)\nI\\'m going to say we can complete both like this:\n  _alternative \\ \n      \"files:file:_path_files\" \\ \n      \"subdirs:subdirectory search:_perforce_subdir_search\"\nThe function _alternative is a little bit like _arguments, but\nthankfully much simpler. It\\'s name gives away its purpose; every\nargument specifies one of a set of possible alternatives, all of which\nare valid at that point --- so the user is offered anything which\nmatches out of the choices, unlike _arguments, which has to decide\nbetween the various possibilities. It\\'s a sort of glorified loop around\n`_describe\\', with _arguments\\'s conventions on the action for\ngenerating completions (up to a point --- _alternative doesn\\'t have\nall the whackier ones, though it does have the ones I\\'ve been talking\nabout so far).\nEach set of possibilities consists of the name of a tag, a description,\nand an argument. The tag isn\\'t present in _arguments. If you use\n^xh to tell you about valid tags, you\\'ll see _arguments has its own\ngeneric tag, argument-rest; this isn\\'t usually all that useful, so we\nare going to supply more specific ones.\nIn the first possibility, it\\'s the standard one for files, `files.\nThe function is the basic low-level one for completing files, too; it\\'s\ndescribed below, but you already know a lot about the effect since it\\'s\nthe completion system\\'s workhorse which you use it all the time without\nrealising. Actually, it will supply its own tags, but that doesn\\'t\nmatter since they will silently override what we say.\nThe second possibility is the new one we\\'re adding. I\\'ve therefore\ninvented a suitable tag `subdirs\\', a description,\n`subdirectory search\\', and the name of the function I\\'m going to\nsupply to do the completion. This is quite simple:\n _perforce_subdir_search() {\n    compset -P '*/'\n    compadd \"$@\" '...'\n  }\nThe first line tells the completion system to ignore anything up to the\nlast `/\\'. That\\'s so we can append a `...\\' to any directory\nwhich already exists on the command line. The builtin compset does\nvarious low-level transformations of this time. Note that the -P is\n`greedy\\' --- it looks for the longest possible pattern match, which\nis the usual default in zsh and other UNIX pattern matchers.\nThe second line actually adds the `...\\' as a completion; compadd\nis the key builtin for the whole completion system. I\\'ve actually\npassed some on the arguments which we got to\n`_perforce_subdir_search\\' via `\"$@\"\\'. In fact, looking back it\nseems as if there weren\\'t any! However, _alternative actually passed\nsome behind my back --- and it\\'s a good thing, too, since it\\'s\nexactly those arguments that give the tag `subdirs\\' and the\ndescription `subdirectory search\\'. So that extra `\"$@\"\\' is\nactually quite important. The buck stops here; there\\'s nothing below\ncompadd. A function of this simplest only works well when the handling\nof tags and contexts has already been done; but we just saw that\n_alternative did that, so as long as we always call\n_perforce_subdir_search suitably, we\\'re in the clear.\nDifferent types of file, part 2\\\nFurthermore, a Perforce file specification can look like a normal UNIX\nfile path, or it can look like:\n  //depot/dirs/moredirs/file\n(don\\'t get confused with paths to network resources, which also use the\ndoubled slash or backslash on some systems, notably Cygwin). We could\nuse _alternative to handle this, too, and if I was writing _perforce\nagain I probably would for simplicity. However, I decided to do it just\nby testing for the `//\\' in _perforce_files. This means that the\nstructure of p4_files so far looks like:\n  if [[ $PREFIX = //* ]]; then\n    # ask Perforce for files that match\n    local -a altfiles\n    altfiles=(\n      'depot-files:file in depot:_perforce_depot_files'\n      depot-dirs:directory in depot:_perforce_depot_dirs'\n    )\n    # add other alternatives, such as the `...' thing\n    altfiles=($altfiles\n      \"subdirs:subdirectory search:_perforce_subdir_search\"\n    )\n    _alternative $altfiles\n  else\n    _alternative \\ \n        \"files:file:_path_files\" \\ \n        \"subdirs:subdirectory search:_perforce_subdir_search\"\n  fi\nwhere we are still to write the functions for the first two alternatives\nin the first branch; the `...\\' is still valid for that branch, so\nI\\'ve added that as the third alternative. I\\'ve used the array\n$altfiles because, actually, the structure is more complicated than\nI\\'ve shown; doing it this way makes it easier to add different sets of\nalternatives.\nThe choice of which branch is made by examining the $PREFIX special\nvariable, which contains everything (well, everything interesting) that\ncomes before the cursor position in the word being completed. There is a\ncounterpart $SUFFIX which we will see in a moment. The `almost\neverything\\' comes because sometimes we definitely don\\'t want to see\nthe whole $PREFIX. Completing the three dots was such as case --- we\ndidn\\'t want to see anything up to the last /. What that\n`compset -P '*/'\\' actually did was move the matched pattern from the\nfront of $PREFIX to the end of $IPREFIX, another special parameter\nwhich contains parts of the completion we aren\\'t currently interested\nin, but which are still there. This allows us to concentrate on a\nparticular part of the completion. However you do that --- whether by\ncompset or directly manipulating $PREFIX and friends --- the\ncompletion system usually restores the parameters when you exit the\nfunction where you altered them. This fits in nicely with what we\\'re\ndoing here with _alternative --- if we handle adding `...\\' by\nignoring everything up to the last slash, for example, we don\\'t want\nthe next completion we try to continue to ignore that; other file\ncompletions will want to look at the directory path.\n`Depot\\' is Perforce\\'s name for what CVS calls a repository --- the\ncentral location where all versions of all files are stored, and from\nwhere they are retrieved when you ask to look at one. I\\'ve separated\nout `depot-dirs\\' and `depot-files\\' for various reasons. First,\nthe commands to examine files and directories are different, so the\ncompletion function is different. Second, we can offer different tags\nfor files and directories --- this is what _path_files does for\nnormal UNIX files. Third, it will later allow us more control --- some\ncommands only operate on directories. Here\\'s _perforce_depot_files;\n_perforce_depot_dirs is extremely similar:\n  _perforce_depot_files() {\n    # Normal completion of files in depots\n    local pfx=${(Q)PREFIX} expl\n    local -a files\n\n    compset -P '*/'\n    files=(${${${(f)\"$(\\ \n_call_program files p4 files \\ \n\\\"\\$pfx\\*\\$\\{\\(Q\\)SUFFIX\\}\\\" 2>/dev/null)\"}%\\#*}##*/})\n    [[ $#files -eq 1 && $files[1] = '' ]] && files=()\n    compadd \"$@\" -a files\n}\nA little messy (and still not quite the full horror). I\\'ve split the\nkey line in the middle which fetches the list from Perforce to make it\nfit. If you ploughed through chapter 5, you\\'ll recognised what\\'s going\non here --- we\\'re reading a list of files, one per line, from the\ncommand `p4 files\\', and we\\'re stripping off the directory at the\nfront, and everything from a `#\\' on at the end. The latter is a\nrevision number; we\\'re not handling those at this point, though we will\nlater.\nNotice the way I remembered $PREFIX before I told the system to ignore\nit for the word we\\'re now completing. I remembered it as\n`${(Q)PREFIX}\\' in order to remove any quotes from the name. For\nexample, if the name on the line so far had a space, $PREFIX (which\ncomes from what is on the command line without any quotes being\nstripped) would have the space quoted somehow, e.g.\n`name\\ with\\  space\\'. We arrange for $pfx to contain\n`name with space\\', which is how Perforce knows the file, using the\n(Q) parameter flag. We then pass the argument \"$pfx*${(Q)SUFFIX}\" to\n`p4 files\\'; this generates matching files internally. The extra\nlayer of backslash-quoting is for the benefit of _call_program, which\nre-evaluates its arguments; this ensures the argument is expanded at the\npoint it gets passed to p4 files. All this goes to show just how\ndifficult getting the quoting right can be.\nOnce we\\'ve got the list of bare filenames, we check to see if the list\nis just one element with no length. That\\'s an artefact of the the\n\"$(cmd)\" syntax; if the output is empty, because its quoted you still\nget one zero-length string output, which we don\\'t want.\nFinally, we pass the result to compadd as before. Again, tags and the\ndescription have already been handled and we just need to make sure the\nappropriate options get passed in with \"$@\". This time we use the\n`-a\\' option which tells compadd that any arguments are array name,\nnot a list of completions. This is more efficient; compadd only needs to\nexpand the array internally instead of the shell passing a potentially\nhuge list to the builtin.\nHandling extra bits on a completion\\\n`Extra bits\\' on a completion could be anything; common examples\ninclude an extra value for a comma-separated list (the _values\nfunctions is for this), or some kind of modifier applied to the\ncompletion you have already. We\\'ve already seen an example, in fact,\nsince the principle of handling the directory and basename parts of a\nfile is very similar. The phrase `extra bits\\' may already alert you to\nthe fact that we are heading towards the deeper recesses of completion.\nAnyway, here\\'s how we tack a revision or change number onto the end of\na file.\nI\\'ll stick with revisions: `filename#revision\\', where\nrevision is a number. For the full sophistication, there are three\nsteps to this. First, make it easy for the user to add `#\\' to an\nexisting filename; second, recognise that a `#\\' is already there so\nthat revisions need to be completed; third, find out the actual\nrevisions which can be completed. As a revision is just a number, you\nmight think completing it was a bit pointless. However, given the\nsophistication of zsh\\'s completion system there\\'s actually one very\ngood reason --- we can supply a description with the revisions, so\nthat the user is given information about the revisions and can pick the\nright one without running some external command to find out. There was\nthe same sort of rationale behind the `-d\\' option to p4 diff;\nthere was just one letter to type, but zsh was able to generate extra\ninformation to describe the possibilities, so it wasn\\'t just laziness.\nFirst part: make it easy for the user to add the `#\\'. This actually\ndepends on a new feature in version 4.1 of zsh; in 4.0 you couldn\\'t\nplay the trick we need or grabbing the keyboard input after a completion\nwas finished unless you specified a particular suffix to add to the\ncompletion (such as the `/\\' after a directory --- this is\nhistorically where this feature came from).\nThe method is to add an extra argument everywhere we complete a file\nname. For example, change the compadd in _perforce_depot_files to:\n compadd \"$@\" -R _perforce_file_suffix -a files\nwhere the option argument specifies a function:\n  _perforce_file_suffix() {\n    [[ $1 = 1 ]] || return\n\n    if [[ $LBUFFER[-1] = ' ' ]]; then\n        if [[ $KEYS = '#' ]]; then\n            # Suffix removal with an added backslash\n            LBUFFER=\"$LBUFFER[1,-2]\\\\\"\n        elif [[ $KEYS = (*[^[:print:]]*|[[:blank:]\\;\\&\\|@]) ]]; then\n            # Normal suffix removal\n            LBUFFER=\"$LBUFFER[1,-2]\"\n        fi\n    fi\n}\nThis has been simplified, too; I\\'ve ignored revision ranges in the form\nfile#rev1,rev2. However, I\\'ve handled changes (`@\\'\nfollowing a filename) as well as revisions. You\\'ll see this function\nlooks much more like a zle widget rather than a completion widget ---\nwhich is exactly what it is; it\\'s not called as part of the completion\nsystem at all. After the specified completion, zle reads in the next\nkeystroke, which is stored in $KEYS, and calls this function as a zle\nwidget. This means it can manipulate the line buffer; we only need to\nlook at what is at the left of the cursor, stored in $LBUFFER.\nThe function is called with the length of the suffix added to the\nfunction. In this case, it\\'s just a space --- we\\'ve finished a\nnormal completion, so the system has automatically added a space to\nwhat\\'s on the command line. We therefore check we\\'ve just got one\nsingle character in the suffix, to avoid getting confused.\nNext, we look at what\\'s immediately left of the cursor, which is the\nlast character in $LBUFFER, i.e. $LBUFFER[-1], to make sure this is\na space.\nIf everything looks OK, we consider the keys typed and decide whether to\nmodify the line. You may already have noticed that in some cases zsh\nautomatically removes that space by itself; for example, if you hit\nreturn --- or any other non-printing character --- or if it\\'s a\ncharacter that terminates a command such as `&\\' or `;\\'. We\nemulate that behaviour --- most of the second test is simply to do\nthat. The only differences from normal are if the key typed was `@\\'\nor `#\\'.\nThe `@\\' is simple --- we just remove the last character, the same\nas we do for the other characters. For `#\\', however, we also add a\nbackslash to the command line before the `#\\'. That\\'s because\n`#\\' is a special character with extended globbing, and the\ncompletion system generally runs with extended globbing switched on.\nAdding the backslash means the user doesn\\'t have to; it\\'s never\nharmful.\nTo show the next effect, suppose we complete a file name:\n p4 diff fil\nto get:\n p4 diff filename _\nwhere `_\\' shows the cursor position, and then typed `#\\'; we\nwould get:\n p4 diff filename\\#\nwith the cursor right at the end.\nSo far so good. For the second step, we need to modify _perforce_files\nto spot that there is a `#\\' on the line before the cursor, and to\ncall the revision code. To do this we add an extra branch at the start\nof the `if\\' in _perforce_files --- at the start, because any\n`#\\' before the cursor forces us to look at revisions, so this takes\nprecedence over the other choices. When this is added, the code will\nlook like:\n  if [[ -prefix *\\# ]]; then\n    _perforce_revisions\n  elif [[ $PREFIX = //* ]]; then\n    # as before.\nIn fact, that -prefix test is just a fancy way of saying the same\nthing as the `[[ $PREFIX = *\\# ]]\\' and if I wasn\\'t so hopelessly\ninconsistent I would have written both tests the same.\nSo now the third step: write _perforce_revisions to complete revisions\nnumbers with the all-important descriptions.\n _perforce_revisions() {\n    local rline match mbegin mend pfx\n    local -a rl\n\n    pfx=${${(Q)PREFIX}%%\\#*}\n    compset -P '*\\#'\n\n    # Numerical revision numbers, possibly with text.\n    if [[ -z $PREFIX || $PREFIX =  ]]; then\n        # always allowed (same as none)\n        rl=($rl 0)\n        _call_program filelog p4 filelog \\$pfx 2>/dev/null |\n           while read rline; do\n            if [[ $rline = (#b)'... #'()*\\'(*)\\' ]]; then\n                rl=($l \"${match[1]}:${match[2]}\")\n            fi\n        done\n    fi\n    # Non-numerical (special) revision names.\n    if [[ -z $PREFIX || $PREFIX !=  ]]; then\n        rl=($rl 'head:head revision' 'none:empty revision'\n                'have:current synced revision')\n    fi\n    _describe -t revisions 'revision' rl\n  }\nThankfully, a lot of the structure of this is already familiar. We\nextract the existing prefix before the `#\\', being careful about\nquoting --- this is the filename for which we want a list of\nrevisions. We ignore everything in the command argument before the\n`#\\'. After generating the completions, we use the _describe\nfunction to add them with the tag `revisions\\' and the description\n`revision\\'.\nThe main new part is the loop over output from `p4 filelog\\', which\nis the Perforce command that tells us about the revisions of a file. We\nextract the revision number and the comment from the line using\nbackreferences (see previous chapter) and weld them together with a\ncolon so that _describe will be able to separate the completion from\nits description. Then we add a few special non-numerical revisions which\nPerforce allows, and pass this list down to _describe. The extra\nif\\'s are a very minor optimization to check if we are completing a\nnumerical or non-numerical revision.\n[]{#l181}\n6.8.4: The rest\nIt\\'s obvious that this tutorial could expand in any number of\ndirections, but as it\\'s really just to point out some possibilities and\ndirections, that would would miss the point. So the rest of this chapter\ntakes the completion system apart and looks at the individual\ncomponents. It should at least now be a bit more obvious where each\ncomponent fits.\n[]{#l182}\n6.9: Writing new completion functions and widgets\nNow down to the nitty gritty. When I first talked about new completion,\nI explained that the functions beginning `_\\' were the core of the\nsystem. For the remainder of the chapter, I\\'ll explain what goes in\nthem in more detail than I did in the tutorial. However, I\\'ll try to do\nit in such a way that you don\\'t need to know every single detail. The\ntrade off is that if you just use the simplest way of writing functions,\nmany of the mechanisms I told you about above, particularly those\ninvolving styles and tags, won\\'t work. For example, much of the code\nthat helps with smart formatting of completion listings is buried in the\nfunction `_description\\'; if you don\\'t know how to call that ---\nwhich is often done indirectly --- then your own completions won\\'t\nappear in the same format as the pre-defined ones.\nThe easiest way of getting round that is to take a dual approach: read\nthe following as far as you need, but also try to find the existing\ncompletion that comes nearest to meeting your needs, then copy that and\nchange it. For example, here\\'s a function that completes files ending\nin .gz (the supplied function which does this has now changed), which\nare files compressed by the gzip program, for use by the corresponding\nprogram that does decompression, gunzip --- hence the file and\nfunction are called _gunzip:\n  #compdef gunzip zcat\n\n  local expl\n\n  _description files expl 'compressed file'\n  _files \"$expl[@]\" -g '*.[gG][zZ]'\nYou can probably see straight away that if you want to design your own\ncompletion function for a command which takes, say, files ending in\n.exe, you need to change three things: the line at the top, which\ngives the names of programmes whose arguments are to be completed here,\nthe description `compressed file\\' to some appropriate string, and\nthe argument following the -g to something like '*.exe' --- any\nglobbing pattern should work, just remember to quote it, since it\nshouldn\\'t be expanded until the inside of the function _files. Once\nyou\\'ve installed that somewhere in your $fpath and restarted the\nshell, everything should work, probably following a longer pause than\nusual as the completion system has to rescan every completion function\nwhen it finds there is a new one.\nWhat you might miss is that the first argument to _description,\n`files\\', is the all-important mystical tag for the type of\ncompletion. In this case, you would probably want to keep it. Indeed,\nthe _files function is used for all file completions of any type, and\nknows all about the other tags --- globbed-files, directories,\nall-files --- so virtually all your work\\'s done for you here.\nIf you\\'re adding your own functions, you will need your own functions\ndirectory. This was described earlier in this guide, but just to remind\nyou: all you need to do is create a directory and add it to $fpath in\neither .zshenv (which a lot of people use) or .zshrc (which some\nsticklers insist on, since it doesn\\'t affect non-interactive shells):\n  fpath=(~/funcs $fpath)\nIt\\'s best to put it before the standard completion directories, since\nthen you can override a standard completion function simply by copying\nit into your own directory; that copy will then be found first and used.\nThis is a perfectly reasonable thing to do with any completion function\n--- although if you find you need to tweak one of the larger standard\nfunctions, that\\'s probably better done with styles, and you should\nsuggest this to us.\n[]{#l183}\n6.9.1: Loading completion functions: compdef\nThe first thing to understand is that top line of _gunzip. The\n`#compdef\\' tag is what tells the system when it checks through all\nfiles beginning with `_\\' that this is a function implementing a\ncompletion. Files which don\\'t directly implement completions, but are\nneeded by the system, instead have the single word `#autoload\\' at\nthat point. All files are only loaded when needed, using the usual\nautoloading system, to keep memory usage down.\nYou can supply various options to the `#compdef\\' tag; these are\nlisted in the `Initialization\\' section of the zshcompsys(1) manual\npage or `Completion System\\' info node. The most useful are -k\nand -K, which allow you to define a completion command and binding\nrather than a function used in a particular context. There are also -p\nand -P which tell the system that what follows is a pattern rather\nthan a literal command name; any command matching the pattern will use\nthat completion function, unless you used -P and a normal\n(non-pattern) completion function for the name was found first.\nFor normal #compdef entries, however, what comes next is a list of\ncommand names --- or rather a list of contexts, since the form\n`-context-\\' can be used here. For example, the function _default\nhas the line `#compdef -default-\\'. You can give as many words as you\nlike and that completion will be used for each. Note that contexts in\nthe colon-separated form can\\'t appear here, just command names or the\nspecial contexts named with hyphens.\nThe system does its work by using a function compdef; it gets as\narguments more or less what you see, except that the function name is\npassed as the first argument. Thus the _gunzip completion is loaded by\n`compdef _gunzip gunzip zcat\\', _default by\n`compdef _default -default-\\', and so on. This simply records the\nname of the function handling the context in the $_comps associative\narray which you\\'ve already met. You can make extra commands/contexts be\nhandled by an existing completion function in this way, too; this is\ngenerally more convenient than copying and modifying the function. Just\nadd `compdef  \\' to .zshrc after the\ncall to compinit.\nIt\\'s also high time I mentioned an easy way of using the completion\nalready defined for an existing function: `compdef newcmd=oldcmd\\'\ntells the completion system that the completion arguments for\n`newcmd\\' are to be the same as the ones already defined for\n`oldcmd\\'; it will complain if nothing is known about completing for\noldcmd. This works recursively; you can now define completions in\nterms of that for newcmd. If you happen to know the name of the\ncompletion function called, you can use that; the following three lines\nare broadly equivalent:\n  compdef $_comps[typeset] foo\n  compdef _vars_eq foo\n  compdef foo=typeset\nsince the completion for typeset is stored in $_comps along with all\nthe others, and this happens to resolve to _vars_eq; but the last\nexample is easier and safer and the intention more obvious. The manual\nrefers to typeset here as a `service\\' for foo (guess what the\nshell stores in the associative array element $_services[foo]).\nThere\\'s actually more to services: when a function is called, the\nparameter $service is set. Usually this will just be the name of the\ncommand being completed for, or one of the special contexts like\n`-math-\\'. However, in a case like the last compdef in the list\nabove, the service will be typeset even though the command name may be\n`foo\\'.\nThis is also used in `#compdef\\' lines. The top of `_gzip\\'\ncontains:\n  #compdef gzip gunzip gzcat=gunzip\nwhich says that the file provides two services, for gzip and gunzip,\nand also handles completion for gzcat, but with the service name\ngunzip. Only a few of the completion functions actually care what\nservice they provide (you can check, obviously, by looking to see if\nthey refer to $service); but you may have uses for this. Note that if\nyou define services with a compdef command, all the arguments must\nbe in the foo=bar form; the mixed form is only useful after a\n#compdef inside completion functions.\n[]{#l184}\n6.9.2: Adding a set of completions: compadd\nOnce you know how to make a new completion function, there is only one\nother basic command you need to know before you can create your own\ncompletions yourself. This is the builtin compadd. It is at the heart\nof the completions system; all its arguments, after the options, are\ntaken as possible completions. This is the list from which the system\nselects the possibilities that match what you have already typed.\nHere\\'s a very basic example which you can type or paste at the command\nline:\n  _foo() { compadd Yan Tan Tethera; }\n  compdef _foo foo\nNow type `foo\\' and experiment with completions after it. If only it\nwere all that simple.\nThere are a whole list of options to compadd, and you will have to\nlook in the zshcompwid(1) manual page or the `Completion\nWidgets\\' info node for all of them. I\\'ve already mentioned -M and\n(long ago) -f. Here are other interesting ones. -X \nprovides a description --- this is used by the format style to pass\ndescriptions, and if you use the normal tags system you shouldn\\'t pass\nit directly; I\\'ll explain this later.\n-P  and -S  allow you to specify bits which are not\ntreated as part of the completion, but appear on the line none the less.\nIn fact, they do two different things: if the prefix or suffix is\nalready there, it is ignored, and if it isn\\'t, it is inserted. There\nare also corresponding hidden and ignored prefixes, necessary for the\nfull power of the completion system, but you will need to read the\nmanual for the full story. The -q option is useful with -S; it\nenables auto-remove behaviour for the suffix you gave, just like /\nwith the AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH option when completing filenames.\n-J  is the way group names are specified, used by the\ngroup-name tag; there is also -V , but the group here is not\nsorted (and is distinct from any group of the same name passed to -J).\n-Q tells the completion code not to quote the words --- this is\nuseful where you need to have unquoted metacharacters in the final\ncompletion. It is also useful when you are completion something where\nthe result isn\\'t going to be expanded by the shell.\n-U tells compadd to use the list of completions even if they don\\'t\nmatch what\\'s on the command line; you will need this if your completion\nfunction modifies the prefix or suffix so that they no longer fit\nwhat\\'s already there. If you use this, you might consider turning on\nmenu completion (using compstate[insert]=menu), since it might\notherwise be difficult to select the appropriate completion.\nFinally, note the -F and -W options which I describe below for\n_files actually are options to compadd too.\n[]{#l185}\n6.9.3: Functions for generating filenames, etc.\nHowever, for most types of completion the possibilities will not be a\nsimple list of things you already know, so that you need to have some\nway of generating the required values. In this section, I will describe\nsome of the existing functions you can call to do the hard work. In the\nnext section I will show how to retrieve information from some special\nparameters made available by the zsh/parameter module.\nFiles etc.: the function _files\\\nYou have already seen _files in action. Calling this with no arguments\nsimply adds all possible files as completions, taking account of the\nword on the command line to establish directories and so on.\nFor more specific use, you can give it various options: `-/\\' means\ncomplete directories, and, as you saw, `-g \"\"\\' gives a\nfilename generation pattern to produce matching files.\nA couple of other options, which can be combined with the ones above,\nare worthy of mention. If you use `-W \\', then completion takes\nplace under directory > rather than in the current directory\n--- it has no effect if you are using an absolute path. Here,\n`\\' can also be a set of directories separated by spaces or,\nmost usefully since it avoids any problems with quoting, the name of an\narray variable which contains the list of possible directories. This is\nessentially how completion for cd with the $cdpath array works. So\nif you have a program that looks for files with the suffix `.mph\\',\nfirst in the current directory, then in a standard directory, say,\n/usr/local/oomph\\', you can do this:\n   local oomph_dirs\n   oomph_dirs=(. /usr/local/oomph)\n  _files -W oomph_dirs -g '*.mph'\n--- note there is no `$\\' before the variable $oomph_dirs here,\nsince it should only be expanded deep inside _files.\nThe system that implements $fignore and the ignored-patterns style\ncan be intercepted, if you need to, with the option `-F \"\"\\';\n`\\' is an array of patterns to ignore, in the usual completion\nformat, in other words the name of a real shell array, or a list of\nvalues inside parentheses. If you make sure all the tags stuff is\nhandled properly, ignored-patterns will work automatically, however,\nand in addition extended globbing allows you to specify patterns with\nexclusion directly, so you probably won\\'t use this feature directly\nunless you\\'re in one of your superhero moods.\nIn addition, _files also takes many of the standard completion options\nwhich apply to compadd, for convenience.\nActually, the function _path_files is the real engine room of the\nsystem. The advantage of using _files is that it prepares all the tags\nfor you, deciding whether you want directories to be completed as well\nas the globbed files, and so on. If you have particularly specific needs\nyou can use _path_files directly, but you won\\'t get the automatic\nfallback one directories and all-files. Because it doesn\\'t handle\nthe tags, _path_files is too lowly to do the usual tricks with label\nloops, i.e. pretending `dog:-setter\\' is a tag `dog-setter\\' with\nthe usual completions for `dog\\'; likewise, it doesn\\'t implement the\nfile-patterns style. So you need to know what you\\'re doing when you\nuse it directly.\nParameters and options\\\nThese can be completed by calls to the _parameters and _options\nfunctions, respectively. Both set up their own tags, and _options uses\nthe matching control mechanism described above to allow options to be\ngiven in all the available forms. As with _files, they will also pass\nstandard compadd options down to that function. Furthermore, they are\nall at a high enough level to handle tags with labels: to translate that\ninto English, you can use them directly without any of the preprocessing\ndescribed later on which are necessary to make sure the styles dealing\nwith tags are respected.\nFor more detailed control with options, the functions _set_options and\n_unset_options behave like _options, but the possible completions\nare limited to options which are set or unset, respectively. However,\nit\\'s not that simple: the completion system itself alters the options,\nand you need to enable some code near the top of _main_complete (it\\'s\nclearly marked) to remember the options which were set or unset when\ncompletion started. A straw poll based on a sample of two zsh developers\nrevealed that in any case many people don\\'t like the completion system\nto second guess the options they want to set or unset in this way, so\nit\\'s probably better just to stick to _options.\nMiscellaneous\\\nThere are also many other completion functions adding matches of a\ncertain type. These can be used in the same way as _parameters and\n_options; in other words they do all the work needed for tags\nthemselves and can be given options for compadd as arguments.\nNormally, these functions are named directly after the type of matches\nthey generate, like _users, _groups, _hosts, _pids, _jobs,\netc.\n[]{#l186}\n6.9.4: The zsh/parameter module\nThe new completion system automatically makes the zsh/parameter module\navailable for use. This provides an easy way of generating arguments for\ncompadd. To get the maximum use out of this, you should be familiar\nwith zsh\\'s rather self-willed syntax for extracting bits out of\nassociative arrays. Note in particular ${(k)assoc}, which expands to a\nlist of the keys of the associative array $assoc, ${(v)assoc}, which\nexpands to just its values (actually, so does $assoc on its own), and\n${(kv)assoc} which produces key/value pairs. For all intents and\npurposes, the keys and values, or the pairs of them, are in a random\norder, but as the completion system does it\\'s own sorting that\nshouldn\\'t be a problem. Mostly, the important parts for completion are\nin the keys, i.e. to add all aliases as possible completions, you need\n`compadd ${(k)aliases}\\'.\nHere\\'s a list of associative and ordinary arrays provided; for more\ninformation on the values of the associative arrays, which could be\nuseful in some cases, consult the section The zsh/parameter Module\nin the zshmodules(1) manual page or the corresponding info node.\nFirst, the associative arrays.\n$aliases, $dis_aliases, $galiases\n:   The keys of these arrays give ordinary aliases, disabled ordinary\n    aliases for those where you have done disable -a  to turn\n    them off temporarily, and global aliases as defined with alias -g.\n$builtins, $dis_builtins\n:   The keys give active and disabled shell builtin commands.\n$commands\n:   The keys are all external commands stored in the shells internal\n    tables; it does this both for the purposes of fast completion, and\n    to avoid having to search each time a command is executed. It\\'s\n    possible that a command is missing or incorrectly stored if the\n    contents of your $path directories has changed since the shell\n    last updated its tables; the rehash command fixes it.\n$functions, $dis_functions\n:   The keys are active and disabled shell functions.\n$history\n:   Here, the values are complete lines stored in the internal\n    history. The keys are the numbers of the history line; it\\'s an\n    associative, rather than an ordinary, array because they don\\'t\n    necessarily start at line 1. However, see the historywords\n    ordinary array below.\n$jobtexts, $jobdirs, $jobstates\n:   These give you information about jobs; the keys are the job numbers,\n    as presented by the jobs command, and the values give you the\n    other information from jobs: $jobtexts tells you what the job is\n    executing, $jobdirs its working directory, and $jobstates its\n    state, where the bit before the colon is the most useful as it\n    refers to the whole job. The remainder describes the state of\n    individual processes in the job.\n$modules\n:   The keys give the names of modules which are currently available to\n    the shell, i.e. loaded or to be autoloaded, essentially the same\n    principle as with functions.\n$nameddirs\n:   If you have named directories, either explicitly (e.g. assigning\n    `foo=/mydir\\' and using `~foo\\') or via the AUTO_NAME_DIRS\n    option, the keys of this associative array give the names and the\n    values the expanded directories.\n$options, $parameters\n:   The keys give shell options and parameters, and are used by the\n    functions _options and _parameters for completion, so you will\n    mostly not need to refer to them directly.\n$userdirs\n:   The keys give all the users on the system. The values give the\n    corresponding home directory, so `${userdirs[juser]}\\' is\n    equivalent to having ~juser expanded and is thus not all that\n    interesting, except that by doing it this way you can test whether\n    the expansion exists without causing an error.\nNow here are the ordinary arrays, which you would therefore refer to\nsimply as ${reswords} etc.\n$dirstack\n:   This contains your directory stack, what you see with `dirs -v\\'.\n    Note, however that the current directory, which appears as number 0\n    with that command, doesn\\'t appear in dirstack. Of course it\\'s\n    easy to add it to a completion if you want.\n$funcstack\n:   This is the call stack of functions, i.e. all the functions which\n    are active at the time the array was referenced. ^Xh uses this to\n    display which functions have been called for completion.\n$historywords\n:   Unlike $history, this contains just the individual words of the\n    shell\\'s command line history, and is therefore likely to be more\n    useful for completion purposes.\n$reswords, $dis_reswords\n:   The active and disabled reserved words (effectively syntactically\n    special commands) understood by the shell.\nOther ways of getting at information\\\nSince the arguments to compadd undergo all the usual shell expansions,\nit\\'s easy to get words from other sources for completion, and you can\nlook in the existing completion functions for many examples. A good\nunderstanding of zsh\\'s parameter and command expansion mechanisms and a\nstrong stomach will be useful here.\nFor example, here is the expansion used by the _limits function to\nretrieve the names of resource limits from the limit command itself:\n  print ${${(f)\"$(limit)\"}%% *}\nwhich you can test does the right thing. Here\\'s a translation:\n\"$(limit)\" calls the command in a quoted context, which means you get\nthe output as if it were a single file (just type `limit\\' to see\nwhat that is). ${(f)...} splits this into an array (it is now outside\nquotes, so splitting will generate an array) with one element per line.\nFinally, ${...%% *} removes the trailing end of each array element\nfrom the first piece of whitespace on, so that\n`cputime         unlimited\\' is reduced to `cputime\\', and so on.\nType `limit ^D\\', and you will see the practical upshot of this.\nThat\\'s by no means the most complicated example. The nested expansion\nfacility is used throughout the completion functions, which adds to\nbrevity but subtracts considerably from readability. It will repay\nfurther study, however.\n[]{#l187}\n6.9.5: Special completion parameters and compset\nUp to now, I\\'ve assumed that at the start of your completion function\nyou already know what to complete. In more complicated cases that won\\'t\nbe the case: different things may need completing in different arguments\nof a command, or even some part of a word may need to be handled\ndifferently from another part, or you need to look for a word following\na particular option. I will first describe some of the lower level\nfacilities which allow you to manipulate this; see the manual page\nzshcompwid(1) or the info node Completion Widgets for the details\nof these. Later, I will show how you can actually skip a lot of this for\nordinary commands with options and arguments by using such functions as\n_arguments, where you simply specify what arguments and options the\nfunction takes and what sort of completion they need.\nThe heart of this is the special parameters made available in completion\nfor testing what has already been typed. It doesn\\'t matter if there are\nparameters of that name outside the completion system; they will be\nsafely hidden, the special values used, and the original values restored\nwhen completion is over.\n$words is an array corresponding to the words on the command line\n--- where by a `word\\' I mean as always a single argument to the\ncommand, which may include quoted whitespace. $CURRENT is the index\ninto that array of the current word. Note that to avoid confusion the\nksh-like array behaviour is explicitly turned off in _main_complete,\nso the command itself is $words[1], and so on.\nThe word being completed is treated specially. The reason is that you\nmay only want to complete some of it. An obvious example is a file with\na path: if you are completing at `foo/bar\\', you don\\'t want to have\nto check the entire file system; you want the directory foo to be\nfixed, and completion just for files in that. There are actually two\nparts to this. First, when completion is entered, $PREFIX and\n$SUFFIX give you the part of the current word before the cursor, and\nthe remainder, respectively. It\\'s done like this to make it possible to\nwrite functions for completing inside a word, not just at the end. The\nsimplest possible way of completing a file is then to find everything\nthat matches $PREFIX*$SUFFIX.\nBut there\\'s more to it than that: you need to separate off the\ndirectory, hence the second part. The parameters $IPREFIX and\n$ISUFFIX contain a part of the string which will be ignored for\ncompletion. It\\'s up to you to decide what that is, then to move the bit\nyou want to be ignored from $PREFIX to $IPREFIX (that\\'s the usual\ncase) or from $SUFFIX to $ISUFFIX, making sure that the word so far\ntyped is still given by $IPREFIX$PREFIX$SUFFIX$ISUFFIX. Thus in\ncompleting foo/bar, you would strip foo/ from the start of $PREFIX\nand tack it onto the end of $IPREFIX --- after recording the fact\nthat you need to move to directory foo, of course. Then you generate\nfiles in foo, and the completion system will happily accept barrack\nor barbarous as completions because it doesn\\'t care about the foo\nany more.\nActually, this is already done by the the _files and _path_files\nfunctions for filename completion. Also, you can get some help using the\ncompset builtin command. In this case, the incantation is\n  if compset -P \"*/\"; then\n    # do whatever you need to with the leading\n    # string up to / stripped off\n  else\n    # no prefix stripped, do whatever's necessary in this case\n  fi\nIn other words, any initial match of the pattern `*/\\' in $PREFIX\nis removed and transferred to the end of $IPREFIX; the command status\ntells you whether this was done. Note that it is the longest possible\nsuch match, so if there were multiple slashes, all will be moved into\n$IPREFIX. You can control this by putting a number  between the\n-P and the pattern, which says to move only up to the th such\nmatch; here, that would be a pattern with exactly  slashes. Note\nthat -P stands for prefix, not pattern; there is a corresponding -S\noption for the suffix. See the manual for other uses of compset; these\nare probably the most frequent.\nIf you want to make the test made by compset, but without the side\neffect of changing the prefixes and suffixes, there are tests like this:\n  if [[ -prefix */ ]]; then\n    # same as with `compset -P \"*/\"', except prefixes were left alone.\n  fi\nThese have the advantage of looking like all the standard tests\nunderstood by the shell.\nThere are three other parameters special to completion. The $QIPREFIX\nand $QISUFFIX are a special prefix and suffix used when you are\ndividing up a quoted word --- for example, in `zsh -c \"echo hi\"\\',\nthe word \"echo hi\" is going to be used as a command line in its own\nright, so if you want to do completion there, you need to have it split\nup. You can use `compset -q\\' to split a word in this fashion.\nThere is also an associative array $compstate, which allows you to\ninspect and change the state of many internal aspects of completion,\nsuch as use of menus, context, number of matches, and so on. Again,\nconsult the manual for more detail. Many of the standard styles work by\naltering elements of $compstate.\nFinally, in addition to the parameters special to completion, you can\nexamine (but not alter) any of the parameters which appear in all\nediting widgets: $BUFFER, the contents of the current editing line;\n$LBUFFER, the part of that before the cursor; $RBUFFER, the rest;\n$CURSOR, the index of the cursor into $BUFFER (with the first\ncharacter at zero, in this case --- or you can think of the zero as\nbeing the point before the first character, which is where insertion\nwould take place with the cursor on the first character); $WIDGET and\n$LASTWIDGET, the names of the current and last editing or completion\nwidget; $KEYS, the keys typed to invoke the current widget;\n$NUMERIC, any numeric prefix given, unset if there is none, and a few\nother probably less useful values. These are described in the\nzshzle(1) manual page and the Zsh Line Editor info node. In\nparticular, I already mentioned $NUMERIC as of possible use in various\nstyles, and it is used by the completers which understand a\n`numeric\\' value in their relevant styles; the $WIDGET and $KEYS\nparameters are useful for deciding between different behaviours based on\nwhat the widget is called (as in _history_complete_word), or which\nkeys are used to invoke it (as in _bash_completions).\nHere are a few examples of using special parameters and compset.\nOne of the shortest standard completions is this, _precommand:\n  #compdef - nohup nice eval time rusage noglob nocorrect exec\n\n  shift words\n  (( CURRENT-- ))\n\n  _normal\nIt applies for all the standard commands which do nothing but evaluate\ntheir remaining arguments as a command, with some change of state, e.g.\nignoring a certain signal (nohup) or altering the priority (nice).\nAll the completion system does here is shift the first word off the end\nof the $words array, decrement the index of the current word into\n$words, and call _normal. This is the function called when\ncompletion occurs not in one of the special -context-s, in other words\nwhen an argument to an ordinary command is being completed. It will look\nat the new command word $words[1], which was previously the first\nargument to nohup or whatever, and start completion again based on\nthat, or even complete that word itself as a command if necessary. The\nnet effect is that the first word is ignored completely, as required.\nHere\\'s just an edited chunk of the file _user_at_host; as its name\nsuggests, it completes words of the form @, and it\\'s used\nanywhere the user-hosts style, described above, is appropriate:\n  if [[ -prefix 1 *@ ]]; then\n    local user=${PREFIX%%@*}\n\n    compset -P 1 '*@'\n\n    # complete the host for which we want the user\n  else\n    # no @, so complete the user\n  fi\nWe test to see if there is already a `@\\' part. If there is, we\nextract the user with an ordinary parameter substitution (so ordinary\neven other shells could do it). Then we strip off that from the bit to\nbe completed with compset; we already know it matches the prefix, so\nwe don\\'t need to test the return value. Then we just do normal hostname\ncompletion on what remains --- except that the user-hosts style\nmight be able to give us a clue as to which hosts have such a user. If\nthe original test failed, then we simply complete what\\'s there as a\nuser.\nFinally, here is essentially what the function _most_recent_file uses\nto extract the $NUMERICth (default first) most recently modified file.\n  local file\n  file=($~PREFIX*$~SUFFIX(om[${NUMERIC:-1}]N))\n  (( $#file )) && compadd -U -i \"$IPREFIX\" -I \"$ISUFFIX\" -f -Q - $file\nInstead of doing it with mirrors, this uses globbing qualifiers to\nextract the required file; om specifies ordering by modification time,\nand the expression in square brackets selects the single match we\\'re\nafter. The N turns on NULL_GLOB, so $file is empty if there are no\nmatches, and the parameter expansions with `$~\\' force patterns in\n$PREFIX and $SUFFIX to be available for expansion (a little extra\nfeature I use, although ordinary completion would work without).\nMost of the compadd command is bookkeeping to make sure the parts of\nthe prefix and suffix we\\'ve already removed, if there are any, get\npassed on, but the reason for that deserves a mention, since normally\nthis is handled automatically. The difference here is that -U usually\nreplaces absolutely everything that was in the word before, so if you\nneed to keep it you have to pass it back to compadd. For example,\nsuppose you were in a context where you were completing after\n`file=... and you had told the completion system that everything up\nto `file=\\' was not to count and not to be shown as part of the\ncompletion. You would want to keep that when the word was put back on\nthe command line. However, `-U\\' would delete that too. Hence the\n`-i \"$IPREFIX\"\\' to make sure it\\'s retained. The same argument goes\nfor the ignored suffix. However, there\\'s currently no way of getting\n_most_recent_file to work on only a part of a string, so this\nexplanation really only applies when you call it from another completion\nfunction, not directly from the command line.\n[]{#l188}\n6.9.6: Fancier completion: using the tags and styles mechanism\nAt this point, you should be in a position to construct, although maybe\nnot in the best possible way, pretty much any completion list you want.\nNow I need to explain how you make sure it all fits in with the usual\ntags and styles system. You will need to pick appropriate tags for your\ncompletions. Although there is no real restriction, it\\'s probably best\nto pick one of the standard tags, some of which are suitably general to\ncover just about anything: files, options, values, etc. There is a\nlist in the completion system manual entry. Remember that the main use\nfor tags is to choose what happens when more than one tag can be\ncompleted in the same place. Finding such things that can\\'t be\nseparated using the standard tag names is a good reason for inventing\nsome new ones; you don\\'t have to do anything special if the tag names\nare new, just make sure they\\'re documented for anyone using the\ncompletion function.\nHow to call functions so that `It Just Works\\'\\\nThe simplest way of making your own completion function recognize tags\nis to use the _description function, which is usually called with\nthree arguments: the name of the tag you\\'re completing for, the name of\na variable which will become an array containing arguments to pass to\ncompadd, and the full description. Then you have to make sure that\narray gets passed down to compadd, or to any of the higher-level\ncompletion functions which will pass the arguments on to compadd. For\nexample,\n  local expl\n  _description files expl 'my special files'\n  _files \"$expl[@]\"\nThis sets the files tag; _description sets $expl to pass on the\ndescription, and maybe other things such as a group name for the tag, in\nthe appropriate format; we pass this down to _files which will use it\nfor calling compadd. Generally, you will call _description for each\ntime you call compadd or something that in turn calls compadd.\nThe _description function calls another function _setup to do much\nof the setting up of styles for the particular tag. Mostly, _setup is\nburied deeply enough that you don\\'t need to worry about it yourself.\nSometimes you can\\'t do completion, and just want to print a message\nunconditionally to say so, irrespective of tags etc.; the function\n_message does this, taking the message as its sole argument.\nThere are two levels above that; these implement the tags mechanism in\nfull. In _description, all that happens is that the user is informed\nwhat tag is coming up; there\\'s no check what preferences the user has\nfor tags (the first level), nor whether he wants tags to be split up\nusing the labelling mechanism, e.g. picking out certain sorts of files\nusing the labelled tag `file:-myfiles\\' to get the final tag\n`file-myfiles\\' (the second level).\nTo get this for simple cases you use the function _wanted. Unlike\n_description, it\\'s an interface to the function that generates\ncompletion as well as a handler for tags --- that\\'s so it can loop\nover the generated tags, checking the labels. The call above would now\nlook like this:\n  _wanted files expl 'my special files' _files\nNote that you now don\\'t pass the \"$expl[@]\", which hasn\\'t even been\nset yet; _wanted will generate the string using the parameter name you\nsay (here `expl\\', as usual), and assume that the function generating\nthe completions can use the result passed down to it. This is true of\npretty much anything you are likely to want to use.\nNote also the fact you need to pass `_files\\', i.e. the function\ngenerating the completion. You can put pretty much any command line\nwhich generates completions here, down to a simple `compadd\\'\nexpression. The reason it has to be here is the tag labelling business:\n_wanted could check whether the tag you specify, `files\\', is\nwanted by the user and then return control to you, but it wouldn\\'t be\nable to split up and loop over labelled tags set in this case for the\nfile-patterns style and in other case by the tag-order style.\nUnless you\\'re really going into the bowels, _wanted is probably the\nlowest level you will want to use. I\\'d suggest you remember that one,\nand only go back and look at the other stuff if you need to do something\nmore complicated.\nIf your function handles multiple tags, you need to loop over the\ndifferent tags to find out which sort the tag order wants next. For\nthis, you first need to tell the system which tags are coming up, using\nthe _tags function with a list. Then you need to to test whether each\ntag in turn actually needs to be completed, and go on doing this until\nyou run out of tags which need completions performing; the _tags\nfunction without arguments does this. Finally, you need to use\n_requested, which works a bit like _wanted but is made to fit inside\nthe loop we are using. The end result looks like this:\n  local expl ret=1\n  _tags foo bar rod\n  while _tags; do\n    _requested foo expl \"This is the description for tag foo\" \\ \n      compadd all foos completions && ret=0\n    _requested bar expl \"This is the description for tag bar\" \\ \n      compadd all bars completions && ret=0\n    _requested rod expl \"This is the description for tag rod\" \\ \n      compadd all rods completions && ret=0\n    (( ret )) || return 0   # leave if matches were generated\n  done\nIf you do include the completion function line as arguments, the loop\nover labels for the tag you specify is automatically handled as with\n_wanted. It may be a little confusing that both _requested and\n_wanted exist: the specific difference is that with _requested you\ncall the _tags function yourself, whereas _wanted assumes the only\nvalid tag is its argument and acts accordingly, and can be used only for\nsimple, `one-shot\\' completions.\nWith _requested, unlike _wanted, you can separate out the arguments\nto the completion generator itself --- here compadd --- into a\ndifferent statement, remembering the \"$expl[@]\" argument in that case.\nYou can miss out the second and third arguments for _requested in this\nway. This time the loop which generates labels for tags is not\nperformed, and you have to arrange it yourself, with the usual trade off\nof greater complexity for greater flexibility. To do this, there are two\nother functions: _all_labels and _next_label. The simpler case is\nwith _all_labels, which just implements the loop over the labels using\nthe same arguments as _wanted:\n  _requested values &&\n     _all_labels values expl 'values for my special things'  \\ \n       compadd alpha bravo charlie delta echo foxtrot.\nIn case you haven\\'t understood (and it\\'s quite complicated, I\\'m\nafraid): the _requested looks at whether the tag you use has been\nasked for by the user. Having found out that it is, the _all_labels\nfunction calls the command compadd which actually adds the\ncompletions, but it does it in such a way as to take account of labelled\ntags --- you might have both a plain `values\\' tag and\n`values:-special\\' labelled tag, and _all_labels is needed to\ndecide which is being used here. This last example is actually exactly\nwhat _requested does when given the compadd as argument, so it\\'s\nonly really useful when there is some code between the _requested and\nthe _all_labels, for example to compute the strings to complete.\nThe most complicated case you are likely to come across is when inside\nthe part of the tags loop which handles a particular tag (i.e. the\n_requested lines in the example above), you actually want to add more\nthan one possible sort of completion. Then _all_labels is no longer\nenough, because completion needs to sort out the different things which\nare being added. This can also happen when there is only one valid tag,\nbut that has multiple completions so that _wanted isn\\'t any use. In\nthis case you need to use _next_label inside a loop, which, as its\nnames suggests, fixes up labels for the current tag and stops when it\\'s\nfound the right one. Here\\'s a stripped down example which handles\ncompletion of messages from the MH mail handling system; you\\'ll find\nit complete inside the function _mh.\n  _tags sequences\n  while _tags; do\n    while _next_label sequences expl sequence; do\n      compadd \"$expl[@]\" $(mark $foldnam 2>/dev/null | \n                           awk -F: '{ print $1 }') && ret=0\n      compadd \"$expl[@]\" reply next cur prev \\ \n          first last all unseen && ret=0\n      _files \"$expl[@]\" -W folddir -g '' && ret=0\n    done\n    (( ret )) || return 0\n  done\nHere\\'s what\\'s going on. The _tags call works just as it did in the\nfirst example I showed for that, deciding whether the tag in question,\nsequences, has been asked for; the tag name comes because MH allows\nyou to define sets of messages called exactly `sequences\\'. The first\n`while\\' selects all values from tag-order where the\n`sequences\\' tag appears, with or without a label. The second\n`while\\' loop then sorts out any occurrences of labelled sequences to\nbe presented to the user at the same time, i.e. given in the same\nelement of the tag-order value array. The first compadd extracts\nfrom the folder (MH\\'s name for a directory) identified by the function\nthe names of any sequences you have defined; the second adds a lot of\nstandard sequences --- although strictly speaking unseen isn\\'t a\nstandard sequence since you can name it yourself in ~/.mh_profile.\nFinally, the third adds files in the folder itself whose names are just\ndigits, which is how MH stores messages. The handling of return makes\nsure it stops as soon as you have matches for one particular element of\ntag-order; if you put it in the inner loop, you would just have the\nfirst of those sets that happened to be generated, while here, if you\nspecify that all types of sequence should appear in the same completion\nlist, they are all correctly collected.\nWhy, in that last example, is there no call to _requested, now I\\'ve\ngone to the trouble of explaining what that does? The answer is that\nthere is only one tag; _tags can decide if we want it at all, and\nafter that the tag is known, so we don\\'t need _requested to find that\ninformation out for us. It\\'s only needed if there is more than one type\nof match --- indeed, that\\'s why we introduced it, so this is not\nactually a new complication, although you can be forgiven for thinking\notherwise.\nHere\\'s an example of using that code for sequences. You might decide\nthat you only want to see named sequences unless there aren\\'t any,\notherwise ordinary messages. You could do this by setting your styles as\nfollows:\n  zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order sequences:-name sequences:-num\n  zstyle ':completion:*:sequences-name' ignored-patterns '(|,)'\n  zstyle ':completion:*:sequences-num' ignored-patterns  '^'\nwhich tries sequences under the labels sequences-name and\nsequences-num; which ignore completions which are all digits, and\nthose which are not all digits, respectively. The slight twiddle in the\npattern for sequences-name ignores messages marked for deletion as\nwell, which have a comma stuck in front of the number (this is\nconfigurable, so your version of MH may be different).\nAll of _description, _wanted, _requested, _all_labels and\n_next_label take the options -J and -V to specify sorted or\nunsorted listings and menus, and the options -1 and -2 for removing\nconsecutive duplicates or all duplicates. These are also options to\ncompadd; the reason for handling them here is that they can be\ndifferent for each tag, and the function called will set expl\nappropriately.\nIf your requirements are simple enough, you can replace that _tags\nloop above with a single function, _alternative. This takes a series\nof arguments each in the form `\\:\\:\\\\',\nwith the first two in the form you now know, and the third an action.\nThese are essentially the same as actions for the _arguments function,\ndescribed below, except that the form `->state\\', which says that the\ncalling function will handle the action itself by using the value of the\nparameter $state, is not available. The most common forms of action\nhere will be a call to another completion function, maybe with arguments\n(e.g. `_files -/\\'), or a simple list in parentheses (e.g.\n`(see saw margery daw)\\'). Here, for example, is how the _cd\nfunction handles the two cases of local directories (under the current\ndirectory) and directories reached via the $cdpath parameter:\n  local tmpcdpath\n  tmpcdpath=(${(@)cdpath:#.})\n  _alternative \\ \n      'local-directories:local directories:_path_files -/' \\ \n      'path-directories:directories in cdpath:\n  _path_files -W tmpcdpath -/'\nThe only tricky bit is that $tmpcdpath: it removes the `.\\' from\n$cdpath, if it\\'s present, so that the current directory is always\nsearched for with the tag `local-directories\\', never with\n`path-directories\\'. Actually, you could argue that it should be\ntreated as being in `path-directories\\' when it\\'s present; but that\nconfuses the issue over what `local-directories\\' really means, and\nit is useful to have the distinction.\nIt\\'s now an easy exercise to replace the example function I gave for\n_requested by a call to _alternative with the arguments to compadd\nturned into a list in parentheses as the  part of the\narguments to _alternative.\nHow to look up styles\\\nIf your completion function gets really sophisticated, you may want it\nto look up styles to decide what its behaviour should be. The same\nadvice goes as for tags: only invent a new style if the old ones don\\'t\nseem to cover the use you want to make, since by using contexts you can\nalways restrict the scope of the style. However, by the same token\ndon\\'t try to squeeze too much meaning into one style, which will force\nthe user to narrow the context --- it\\'s always much easier to set a\nstyle for the general context `:completion:*\\' than to have to worry\nabout all the circumstances where you need a particular value.\nRetrieving values of styles is no harder than defining them, but you\nwill need to know about the parameter $curcontext, which is what\nstores the middle part of the context, sans `:completion:\\' and sans\ntag. When you need to look something up, you pass this context to\nzstyle with `:completion:\\' stuck in front:\n  zstyle -b \":completion:${curcontext}:tag\" style-name parameter\nIf the tag is irrelevant, you can leave it empty, but you still need the\nfinal colon since there should always be six in total. In some cases\nwhere multiple tags apply it\\'s useful to have a :default tag context\nas a fall back if none of the actual tags yield styles for that context;\nhence you should test the style first for the specific tag, then with\nthe default.\nStyle lookups all have the form just shown; the result for looking up\nstyle-name in the given context will be saved in the parameter\n(which you should make local, obviously). In addition, zstyle returns\na zero status if the lookup succeeded and non-zero if it failed. The\n-t lookup is different from the rest as it only returns a status for a\nboolean, i.e. returns status 0 if the value is true, yes, 1 or\non, and doesn\\'t require a parameter name. There is also a -T, which\nis identical except that it returns status 0 if the style doesn\\'t\nexist, i.e. the style is taken to default to true.\nThe other lookup options return the style as a particular type in the\nparameter with exit status zero if the lookup succeeded, i.e. a value\nwas found, and non-zero otherwise; -b, -s, and -a specify boolean\n(parameter is either yes or no), scalar (parameter is a scalar),\nand array (parameter is an array, which may still be a single word, of\ncourse), You can retrieve an associative array with -a as long as the\nparameter has already been declared as one.\nThere\\'s also a convenience option for matching, -m; instead of a\nparameter this takes a pattern as the final argument, and returns\nstatus zero if and only if the pattern matches one of the values\nstored in the style for the given context.\nTypical usages are thus:\n  if zstyle -t \":completion:${curcontext}:\" foo; then\n    # do things in a fooish way\n  else\n    # do things in an unfooish way\n  fi\nor to use the value:\n  local val\n  if zstyle -s \":completion:${curcontext}:\" foo val; then\n    # use $val to establish how fooish to be\n  else\n    # be defaultly fooish\n  fi\n[]{#l189}\n6.9.7: Getting the work done for you: handling arguments etc.\nThe last piece of unfinished completion business is to explain the\nhigher level functions which can save you time writing completions for\ncommands which behave in a standard way, with arguments and options. The\ngood news is that all the higher functions here handle tags and labels\ninternally, so you don\\'t need to worry about _tags, _wanted,\n_requested, etc. There\\'s one exception: the `state\\' mechanism to be\ndescribed, where a function signals you that you\\'re in a given state\nusing the parameter $state, expects you to handle tag labels yourself\n--- pretty reasonable, as you have requested that the function return\ncontrol to you to generate the completions. I\\'ve mentioned that here so\nthat I don\\'t have to gum up the description of the functions in this\nsection by mentioning it again.\nHandling ordinary arguments\\\nThe most useful function is _arguments. There are many examples of\nthis in the completion functions for external commands, since so many\nexternal commands take the standard format of a command with options,\nsome taking their own arguments, plus command arguments.\nThe basic usage is to call it with a series of arguments (which I\\'ll\ncall `specifications\\') like:\n   ::\nalthough there are a whole series of more complicated possibilities.\nThe initial `\\' part tells the function whether the\nspecification applies to an argument in a particular position, or to an\noption and possibly any arguments for that option. Let\\'s start with\nordinary arguments, since these are simpler. In this case\n`\\' will be either a number, giving the number of the\nargument, or a `*\\', saying that this applies to all remaining\narguments (or all arguments, if you haven\\'t used any of the other\nform). You can simplify the first form, by just missing out the number;\nthen the function will assume it applies to the first argument not yet\nspecified. Hence the standard way of handling arguments is with a series\nof specifications just beginning `:\\' for arguments that need to be\nhandled their own way, if any, then one beginning `*: for all\nremaining arguments, if any.\nThe message that follows is a description to be passed on down to\n_description. You don\\'t specify the tags at this point; that comes\nwith the action.\nThe action can have various forms, chosen to be easily distinguishable\nfrom one another.\n\nA list of strings in parentheses, such as\n`(red blue      green)\\'. These are the possible completions,\npassed straight down to compadd.\n\nThe same, but with double parentheses; the list in this case\nconsists of the completion, a backslashed colon, and a description.\nSo an extended version of the previous action is\n`((red\\:The\\       colour\\ red blue\\:The\\ colour\\ blue))\\' and so\non. You can escape other colons inside the specifications in this\nway, too.\n\nA completion function to call, with any arguments, such as\n`_files -/\\' to complete directories. Usually this does the\nbusiness with $expl which should be familiar from the section on\nbasic tag handling, however you can put an extra space in front of\nthe action to have it called exactly as is, after word splitting.\n\nA word preceded by `->\\' for example `->state\\'. This\nspecifies that _arguments should return and allow the calling\nfunction to process the argument. To signal back to the calling\nfunction, the parameter $state will be set to what follows the\n`->\\'. It\\'s up to the calling function to make $state a local\nparameter --- _arguments can\\'t do that, since then it couldn\\'t\nreturn a value.\nYou should also make the parameters $context and $line local;\nthe former is set to the new part to be added to $curcontext,\nwhich, as you can find out from ^Xh, is option--,\nfor example option-file-1 for the first argument of the\noption-file option, or argument-N, for example argument-2 for\nthe second argument of the command.\nIn simple cases, you will just test the parameter $state after\n_arguments has returned to see what to do: the return value is 300\nto distinguish it from other returns where _arguments itself\nperformed the completion.\n\nA chunk of code to evaluate, given in braces, which removes the need\nfor a special function or processing states. Obviously this is best\nused for the simplest cases.\n\n\nThese are the main possibilities, but I have not described every\nvariation. As always, you should see the manual for all the detail.\nHere\\'s a concocted example for that `->state\\' action specifier, in\ncase it\\'s confusing you. It\\'s for a command that takes arguments\n`alpha\\', `beta\\' and `gamma\\', and takes a single option\n`-type\\' which takes one argument, either `normal\\' or\n`unusual\\'.\n  local context state line\n  typeset -A opt_args\n\n  _arguments '-type[specify type]:type:->type' \\ \n             '*:greek letter:->gklet' && return 0\n\n  case $state in\n    (type)  compadd normal unusual && return 0\n            ;;\n    (gklet) compadd alpha beta gamma && return 0\n            ;;\n  esac\n\n  return 1\nIn fact the possibilities here are so simple that you don\\'t need to use\n$state; you can just use the form with the values in parentheses as\nthe action passed to `_arguments\\'. Anyway, if you put this into a\nfunction `_foo\\', type `compdef _foo foo\\', and attempt completion\nfor the fictitious command `foo\\', you will see _arguments in\naction.\nI haven\\'t shown the gory tag handling; as it\\'s written, you\\'ll see\nthat no tag is ever defined for the compadd arguments shown. In this\ncase you could just use _wanted. What you get for free with arguments,\nhowever, is the context: in the first case, you would have\n`:option-type-1\\' in the argument field (the second last, just before\nthe tag), and in the second case `:argument-rest:\\'. Go back to where\nI originally described contexts if you\\'ve forgotten about these; I\ndidn\\'t tell you at the time, but it\\'s the _argument function that is\nresponsible for them. (However, you can supply a `-C\\' argument to\n_wanted to tell that a context.)\nA note about the form: that `&& return 0\\' makes the completion\nfunction return if _arguments was satisfied that it found a completion\non its own. It\\'s useful in more complex cases. Remember that most\ncompletion functions return status zero if and only if matches were\nadded; this function is written to follow that convention. I already\nshowed this in the section on tags, but you might have skipped that.\nNote all the things you had to make local: $context, $state, $line\nand the associative array $opt_args. The last named allows you to\nretrieve the values for a particular option; for example\n`$opt_args[-o]\\' contains any value already on the command line for\nthe option -o. For options that take multiple arguments, these appear\nseparated by colons, so if the line contains `-P prefix 3\\',\n$opt_args[-P] will contain `prefix:3\\'.\nHandling options\\\nOption handling is broadly similar, with the `\\' part\njust giving the option name --- I already showed one example with\n`-type\\' above. In this case, the option will just be completed to\nitself, the first part of the specification, and the rest says how to\ncomplete its arguments. Since options can take any number of arguments,\nincluding zero, the :description:action pair can be repeated, or\nomitted entirely. Otherwise, it behaves similarly to the way described\nfor ordinary command arguments, with all the same possible actions. So a\nsimple option specification could be\n  _arguments '-turnmeon'\nfor an option with no arguments,\n  _arguments '-file:input file:_files'\nfor an option with one argument, or\n  _arguments '-iofiles:input file:_files:output file:_files'\nfor an option with two arguments, both files but with different\ndescriptions.\nThe first part of the specification for an option can be more\ncomplicated, to reflect the fact that options can be used in all sorts\nof different ways. You can specify a description for the option itself\n--- as I tried to explain, the descriptions in the rest of the\nspecification are instead for the arguments to the option. To specify an\noption description, just put that after the option, before any colons,\nin square brackets:\n  _arguments '-on[turn me on, why not]'\nNext, some options to a command are mutually exclusive. As _arguments\nhas to read its way along the command line to parse it, it can record\nwhat options have already appeared, and can ensure that an option\nincompatible with one there already will not be completed. To do this,\nyou need to include the excluded option in parentheses before the option\nitself:\n  _arguments '(-off)-on[turn me on, why not]' \\ \n             '(-on)-off[turn me off, please]'\nThis completes either of the options `-on\\' or `-off\\', but if\nyou\\'ve already given one, it won\\'t complete the other on the same\ncommand line. If you need to give multiple excluded options, just list\nthem separated by spaces, like `(-off -noton)\\'.\nSome options can themselves be repeated; _arguments usually won\\'t do\nthat (in a sense, they are mutually exclusive with themselves), but you\ncan allow it to happen by putting a `*\\' in front of the option\nspecification:\n  _arguments '*-o[specify extra options]:option string:->option'\nallows you to complete any number of `-o \\' sets using the\n$state mechanism. The * appears after any list of excluded options.\nThere are also ways of allowing different methods of option handling. If\nthe option is followed by -, that means the value must be in the same\nword as the option, instead of in the next word; if that is allowed, but\nthe argument could be in the next word instead, the option should be\nfollowed by a `+\\'. The latter behaviour is very common for commands\nwhich take single letter options. Some commands, particularly many\nrecent GNU commands, allow you to have the argument in the next word or\nin the current word after an `=\\' sign; you get this by putting an\n`=\\' after the option name. For example,\n  _arguments '-file=:input file:_files'\nallows you to complete `-file\\\\' or\n`-file=\\\\'. With\n   _arguments '-file=-:input file:_files'\nonly the second is possible, i.e. the argument must be after the\n`=\\', not in its own word.\nYou can handle optional and repeated arguments to options, too. This\nillustrates some possibilities:\n  _arguments '-option:first arg:->first::optional arg:->second'\nThe doubled colon indicates that the second argument is optional. In\nother words, at that point on the command line _arguments will either\ntry to complete via the state second, or will try to start another\nspecification entirely.\n  _arguments '-option:first arg:->first:*:other args:->other'\nHere, all arguments after the first --- everything else on the command\nline --- is taken as an argument to the option, to be completed using\nthe state other.\n  _arguments '-option:first arg:->first:*-:other args till -:->other'\nThis is similar, but less drastic: there is a pattern after the `*\\',\nhere a `-\\', and when that is encountered, processing of arguments to\n`-option\\' stops. A command using this might be called as follows:\n  cmdname -option    .... - \nwhere of course completion for  might be handled by other\nspecifications.\nThere are yet more possible ways of handling options. I\\'ve assumed that\noption names can have multiple letters and hence must occur in separate\nwords. You can specify single-letter options as well, of course, but\nmany commands allow you to combine these into one word. To tell\n_arguments that\\'s OK you should give it the option -s; it needs to\ncome before any specifications, to avoid getting mixed up with them.\nAfter you specify this, a command argument beginning with a single\n`-\\' will be treated by _arguments as a list of single options, so\n`-lt\\' is treated the same as `-l -t\\'. However, options beginning\nwith `-``-\\' are still treated as single options, so a\n`-``-prefix\\' on the command line is still handled as a single long\noption by _arguments.\nOne nice feature which can save a lot of trouble when using certain\ncommands, notably those written by the GNU project and hence installed\non most Linux-based systems, which take an option `-``-help\\' that\nprints out a list of all options. This is in a human-readable form, but\n_arguments is usually able to extract a list of available options\nwhich use the `-``-...\\' form, and even in many cases whether they\ntake an argument, and if so what type that is. It knows because\n` -``-help\\' often prints out a message like\n`-``-file=FILE\\' which would tell _arguments (1) that\n`-``-file\\' is a possible option (2) that it takes an argument\nbecause of the `=\\' (3) that that argument should be a file because\nof the message `FILE\\' at the end.\nYou specify that the command in question works in this way by using the\n(fairly memorable) option `-``-\\' to `_arguments\\'. You can then\nhelp it out with completion of option arguments by including a pattern\nto be matched in the help test after the `-``-\\'; the format is\notherwise similar to a normal specification. For example\n`*=FILE*:file:_files\\' says that any option with `=FILE\\' in it\nhas the description `file\\' and uses the standard _files function\nfor completion, while `*=DIR*:directory:_files -/\\' does the same for\ndirectories. These two examples are so common that they are assumed by\n`_arguments -``-\\'.\nSo for example, here is the completion for gdb, the GNU debugger,\nwhich not surprisingly understands the GNU option format:\n  _arguments -- '*=(CORE|SYM)FILE:core file:_files' \\ \n                '*=EXECFILE:executable:_files -g \\*\\(\\*\\)' \\ \n                '*=TTY:terminal device:compadd /dev/tty\\*' && return 0\nIf you run `gdb --help\\', you\\'ll see where these come from:\n`--core=COREFILE\\', `--exec=EXECFILE\\' and `--tty=TTY\\' are all\nlisted as possible option/argument pairs. Doing it this way neatly\nallows the argument completions to work whatever the names of the\noptions --- though of course it\\'s possible for the rest of the\npattern to change, too, and the commands, being written by lots of\ndifferent people, are not necessarily completely consistent in the way\ntheir help text is presented.\n[]{#l190}\n6.9.8: More completion utility functions\nThis is now just a ragbag of other functions which might prove useful in\nyour own completion functions, and which haven\\'t been mentioned before,\nwith some examples; once again, consult the manual for more detail. Note\nthat many of these functions can take the most useful arguments to\ncompadd and pass them on, even where I haven\\'t explicitly said so.\n_call_function\\\nThis is a simple front end to calling a function which may not be\ndefined and hanging onto the return status of the function. One good use\nfor this is to call a possibly non-existent function which might have\nbeen defined by the user, before doing some default stuff the user might\nwant to skip. That would look like this:\n  local ret  # returned status from called function, if it was called\n\n  _call_function ret _hook_function arg1 arg2  &&  return ret\n\n  # if we get here, _hook_function wasn't called,\n  # so do the default stuff.\nAs you can work out, _call_function itself returns status zero if the\nfunction in the second argument got called, and in that case the first\nargument is the name of a parameter with the return status from the\nfunction itself. The whole point is that this is safe if\n_hook_function doesn\\'t exist.\nThis function is too low level to know about the tags mechanism; use\n_wanted or similar to handle tags properly.\n_contexts\\\nThis is another shorthand: the arguments it takes are a set of short\ncontexts, in other words either names of commands or special contexts\nlike `-math-\\'. The completion for each of these contexts is tried in\nturn; _contexts simply handles all the boring looking up of functions\nand testing the return values. The definition, if you want to look, is\nreassuringly simple. It only has one use at the moment: _subscript,\nwhich handles the -subscript- context we met early in the chapter,\ncalls `_contexts -math-\\' to try mathematical completion, since\nordinary array subscripts can contain mathematical expressions.\nThis is also too low level to handle tags. In zsh 4.1, it is made\nobsolete by a cleverer mechanism for handling different contexts which\ncan be used, for example, for handling of arguments to redirections for\nparticular commands, or keys in a particular associative array. I expect\nI\\'ll describe that when 4.1 is finally released.\n_describe\\\nDon\\'t confuse this with _description which was explained above and is\nthe basic function for adding a description to a set of completions of a\ncertain type. I mentioned in the description of the verbose style that\nthis function was responsible for showing, or not showing, the\ndescriptions for a whole lot of options at once. It allows you to do\nthat with several different sets of completions that may require\ndifferent options to compadd. The general form looks something like\nthis:\n  _describe \"description of set 1\" descs1 compls1 \\ \n                -- \\ \n            \"description of set 2\" ...\nwhere you can have any number of sets separated by the `-``-\\'. The\ndescs1 and compls1 are arrays of the same length, giving a list of\ndescriptions and a list of completions, respectively. Alternatively, you\nneed only give one array name and each element of that will contain a\ncompletion and a description separated by the now-traditional colon. The\n`\\' are a set of any old options recognised by\ncompadd, such as -q, or -S=/, or what have you. I won\\'t give an\nexample for this, since to find something requiring it would almost need\nme to rewrite the completion system from scratch.\n_combination\\\nThis is the function at the heart of the completions such as\nusers-hosts described above, where combinations of elements need to be\ncompleted at the same time. It\\'s easiest to describe with an example;\nlet\\'s pick the users-hosts example, and I\\'ll assume you remember how\nthat works from the user\\'s point of view, including the format of the\nusers-hosts style itself. The completion for the username part is\nperformed as:\n  _combination my-accounts users-hosts users\nwhere my-accounts is the tag to be used for the completion, then comes\nthe style, and then the part of the style to be extracted.\nNow suppose we come back into the completion function again to complete\nthe host later on the command line, so that the username is already\nthere. We can find that by searching the command line; suppose we store\nwhat we find in $userarg. Then we can complete the hostname as\nfollows:\n  _combination my-accounts users-hosts users=$userarg hosts\nand the magic part, the fact that we can limit the hostnames to be\ncompleted to only those with a user $userarg, is handled by\n_combination. This extends to hosts-ports-users and any larger\ncombined set in the obvious way: the first field not to contain an\n`=\\' is the one being completed. You don\\'t need to supply other\nfields if they are not known; in other words, the field to be completed\ndoesn\\'t need to be the first one in sequence not known, it can be any,\njust as long as it matches part of the style given in the second\nargument, so you could have omitted the `users=$userarg\\' in the last\nexample if you couldn\\'t extract the right username.\nThere are various bells and whistles: after the field to be completed\nyou can add any options to be passed down to compadd; you can give\n_combination itself the option `-s \\' to specify a character\nother than colon to separate the parts of the style values; if the style\nlookup fails, but there is a corresponding function, which would be\ncalled `_users\\' or `_hosts\\' in this example, it is called to\ngenerate the matches, and gets the options at the end which are\notherwise destined for compadd.\nAs you can see, this function is at a high enough level to handle the\ntags mechanism itself.\n_multi_parts\\\nThis takes two arguments, a separator and a list of matches. The list of\nmatches is normal, except that each element is likely to contain the\nseparator. In the most obvious usage, the separator is `/\\' and the\nlist of matches is a lot of files with path components. Here\\'s another\nreasonable usage:\n  local groups expl\n  groups=($(awk -F: '{ print $1 }' ~/.newsrc))\n  _wanted groups expl 'newsgroup' _multi_parts \"$expl[@]\" . groups\nThe generated array contains names of Usenet newsgroups, i.e. names with\ncomponents separated by a `.\\', and _multi_parts allows you to\ncomplete these piece by piece instead of in one go. This is a good deal\nbetter for use with menu completion, and the list which appears is\nsmaller too. The _wanted part handles the tags mechanism, which\n_multi_parts doesn\\'t.\n_sep_parts\\\nThis also completes a word piece by piece, but unlike _multi_parts the\ntrial completions are also only supplied for each piece. The arguments\nare alternating arrays and separators; arrays are in the usual form, in\nother words either the name of an array parameter, or a literal array in\nparentheses, quoted to protect it from immediate shell expansion. The\nseparators are simply strings. For example\n  local expl\n  array1=(apple banana cucumber)\n  _wanted breakfast expl 'breakfast' \\ \n    _sep_parts array1 + '(bread toast croissant)' @ '(bowl plate saucer)';  \ncompletes strings like `apple+toast@plate\\', piece by piece. This is\ncurrently not used by the distributed completion code.\n_values\\\nThis works a little like _arguments, but is designed for completing\nthe values of a single argument in a form like\n`key=val,flag,key=other\\', in which you can specify the list\nseparator, here `,\\' by using the option -s, e.g. `-s ,\\'. The\nfirst argument to _values is the overall description of the set of\narguments. The other arguments are very much like those to _arguments\nexcept that, as you would expect from the form given, no pluses or minus\nsigns are involved and each value can only have one argument, which must\nfollow an `=\\'. Virtually everything else is identical, with the\nexception that the associative array where the arguments are stored for\neach value is called $val_args.\nI won\\'t bother giving the instructions for _arguments again; instead,\nhere is an example based on the values used by the -o option to the\nmount command:\n  local context state line\n  typeset -A val_args\n\n  _values -s , 'file system options' \\ \n    '(rw)ro[mount file system read-only]' \\ \n    '(ro)rw[mount file system read-write]' \\ \n    'uid[set owner of root]:user ID:' \\ \n    'gid[set group of root]:group ID:' \\ \n    'bs[specify block size]:block size:(512 1024 2048 4192)'\nI\\'ve just picked out a few of the umpteen possibilities for\nillustration; see the function _mount if you want more. Remember that\nthe `(rw)\\' before the `ro\\' means that the options are mutually\nexclusive, and the one in parentheses won\\'t be offered if the other\nappears on the command line; the strings in square brackets are\ndescriptions of the particular options; and if there is a colon after\nthe name of the value, the value takes an argument whose own description\ncomes next. The second colon is followed by possible completions for\nthat argument, using the usual convention for actions in _arguments;\nas you\\'ll see from the local statement, the $state mechanism can be\nused here. Only the `bs\\' argument here is given possible\ncompletions; for uid and gid you\\'ll have to type in the number\nwithout completion; ro and rw don\\'t take arguments.\nHence a typical(?) list to be completed by this would be\n`rw,uid=123,bs=2048\\'.\nRemember also that you can use a `*\\' before the option name to say\nthat it can appear more than once in the value list. The _values\nfunction handles the context and tags in a similar way to _arguments.\n_regex_arguments\\\nThis function is for use when the behaviour of a set of command\narguments is so complicated that even _arguments can\\'t help. It\nallows you to describe the arguments as a regular expression (i.e. a\npattern). I won\\'t explain it because I haven\\'t yet figured out how it\nworks. If you think you need to use it, look at the manual entry and\nthen at the _apt function which is currently its main application.\n[]{#l191}\n6.10: Finally\nCompletion is big and complex: this means that there are probably lots\nof bugs around, and things that I haven\\'t described simply enough or\nwhich may be implemented in too complicated a way. Please send the\nzsh-workers mailing list any reports or constructive criticism on the\nsubject.\nLast of all, remember that the new completion system is ideally just\nsupposed to work without you needing to worry exactly how. That\\'s a\nbold hope, but at least much of the time you should be able to get away\nwith using just the tab key and ordinary characters.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide07.html":{"url":"zshguide07.html","title":"章节 7","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n[]{#ragbag}[]{#l192}\nChapter 7: Modules and other bits and pieces Not written\n[]{#l193}\n7.1: Control over modules: zmodload\n[]{#l194}\n7.1.1: Modules defining parameters\n[]{#l195}\n7.1.2: Low-level system interaction\n[]{#l196}\n7.1.3: ZFTP\n[]{#l197}\n7.2: Contributed bits\n[]{#l198}\n7.2.1: Prompt themes\n[]{#l199}\n7.3: What\\'s new in 4.1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter\n\n\n"},"zshguide08.html":{"url":"zshguide08.html","title":"章节 8","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable of Contents\nPrevious Chapter\n\n\n[]{#l200}\nAppendix 1: Obtaining zsh and getting more information Not written\n[]{#appa}\n"}}}
